## Introduction

Reviewing atoms, bonds, and molecular geometry.

* Atomic Structure: the Nucleus
* 

## Why?

Anyone with a curiosity about life and living things must first understand organic chemistry. Organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds.

## How?

### Atom

* a dense, positively charged nucleus
  * subatomic particles called protons, which are positively charged
  * neutrons, which are electrically neutral
* surrounded at a relatively large distance by negaively charged electrons
* number of positive protons in the nucleus = number of negative electrons
