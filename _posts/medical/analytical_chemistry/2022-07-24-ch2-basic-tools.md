## Introduction

quick explanation

## Why?

focus on why we need it

## How?

### numerical tools

* use base SI units for absolute; for example, the kilogram for mass
* use concentration for relative
  * percentage: molarity, weight percent, volume percent, weight-to-volume percent, parts per million and parts per billion
  * stoichiometric relationships

### experimental tools

Should understand the equipments in analytical lab such as balances, volumetric flasks, pipets, and ovens.

## What?

### example of numerical tools

### example of experimental tools

### key term

* analytical balance: balance designed to measure small mass in the sub-milligram range
* desiccator: sealable enclosures containing desiccants used for preserving moisture-sensitive items
* graduated cylinder: measure the volume of a liquid
* molarity: units of moles of solute per litre of solution
* parts per billion: the number of units of mass of a contaminant per 1000 million units of total mass
* scientific notation: a way of writing very large or very small numbers
* stock solution: skip
* volumetric pipette: allows extremely accurate measurement of the volume of a solution
* concentration: skip
* dilution: the process of decreasing the concentration, like adding more water to the solution
* meniscus: the curve in the upper surface of a liquid close to the surface of the container or another object, caused by surface tension
* normality: skip
* p-function:
* significant figures
* volume percent
* weight percent
* desiccant
* formality
* molality
* parts per million
* quantitative transfer
* SI units
* volumetric flask
* weight-to-volume percent
