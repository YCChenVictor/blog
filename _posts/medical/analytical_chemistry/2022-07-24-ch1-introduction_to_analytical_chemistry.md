## Introduction

This article describes the basic concept of analytical chemistry with following concepts:

* qualitative analyses
* quantitative analysis
* characterization analysis
* fundamental analysis

## Why?

focus on why we need it

## How? & What?

### procedure of analytical chemistry

Steps:

  id1((1)) --> id2((2))
  id2((2)) --> id3((3))
  id3((3)) --> id4((4))
  id4((4)) --> id2((2))
  id4((4)) --> id5((5))
</div>

* 1: Identify and Define Problem
* 2: Design Experimental Procedure
* 3: Conduct Experiment & Gather Data
* 4: Analyze Experimental Data
* 5: Propose Solution to Problem

### types of analytical problem

* qualitative analyses

## Note

* Analytical chemistry often is described as the area of chemistry responsible for characterizing the composition of matter, both qualitatively (Is there lead in this paint chip?) and quantitatively (How much lead is in this paint chip?)

* Here is one example of the distinction between analytical chemistry and chemical analysis. A mining engineers evaluates an ore by comparing the cost of removing the ore from the earth with the value of its contents, which they estimate by analyzing a sample of the ore. The challenge of developing and validating a quantitative analytical method is the analyti- cal chemist’s responsibility; the routine, daily application of the analytical method is the job of the chemical analyst.

* Perhaps a more appropriate description of analytical chemistry is “the science of inventing and applying the concepts, principles, and...strategies for measuring the characteristics of chemical systems.

* What is the analytical perspective? Many analytical chemists describe this perspec- tive as an analytical approach to solving problems.
