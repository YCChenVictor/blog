## Introduction

This pattern

* makes my code prettier just like facade increase the taste of my house even thought my house is messy
* belongs to structural patterns, so it structures a specific kind of objects
* deal with **complex** set of objects, which these objects did not follow any particular structure; they should be **messy**

<div id='facade' class='h-screen justify-center items-center'>
  <div id='facade_toggle_erase' class=''></div>
  <div id='facade_image_save' class=''></div>
  <div id='facade_canvas' class='border'></div>
</div>

<script>
  const id = 'facade'
  let binarySearchTree = p5Draw(id)
  let binarySearchTreeP5 = new p5(binarySearchTree, id);
</script>

## Why?

We only care about the aspects we care; for example, given a delivery system,

* user cares when the package arrives
* boss cares the profit of this delivery

Even thought the process of delivering involves shippings, air transport, ...etc and it is truly complicate, they do not care. We should prepare the system to have clean interfaces (facades) for them to acquire the information they want.

## How?

## What?

An implementation:

```ruby
class OceanShippingService
  # returns the estimates of delivery time and profit
end

class AirTransportationService
  # returns the estimates of delivery time and profit
end

class LandTransportationService
  # returns the estimates of delivery time and profit
end

class Package
  # returns a packed deliverable goods
end

class Routes
  # returns the best routes given the conditions such as weight of package, time, fees ...etc
end

class WhatWeCare # facade
  def initialize(origin, destination, item)
    @origin = origin
    @destination = destination
    @item = item
  end

  def when_it_arrives
    routes = Routes.new(@origin, @destination)
  end

  def profit
  end
end

when_it_arrives = WhatWeCare.new('origin', 'desintation', 'item').when_it_arrives
profit = WhatWeCare.new('origin', 'desintation', 'item').profit
```
