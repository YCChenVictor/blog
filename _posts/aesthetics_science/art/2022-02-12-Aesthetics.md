## Introduction

Aesthetic experiences include listening to music in any place, stickers on my laptop, feelings when looking at sunset, savoring the first bite of meal, emotionally investing in the characters in movie or noval.

Aesthetic was invented by Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten. He defined what a good art is by studying good and bad taste, linking good taste with beauty.

Art imitates the objects and events of ordinary life. - Plato

The aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance. - Aristotle

## Why?

Given we have various art (we do not define why we need art here) -> Aesthetic defines good taste of art -> It should be accepted by people but not tawdry -> just like one to many -> ... -> the combination of one person's sensories and universe

## How?

1. Truely feel the gift from universe
2. express the feelings with your own prespective
3. mingle them

### gift from universe

You need to touch it. The ways would be traveling to know through nature, reading to know through other people's eye, religious beliefs to explore inner world.

### the feelings

The feelings should be true part of yourself. The feelings towards nature. The true feelings. Express the true desire. Try to know the deepest desire of your own. What is my central idea? What am I going to mingle with the gift from universe?

### mingle them

Document them, through writing, drawing, music, cooking, ...etc

## What?

give an example
