## Introduction

This article is essential for me to get the styles I need for design of my life, music, drawing, origami, website, ...etc. Based on my core values, I think something of minimalist is best suit for me.

## Why?

Ok, actually, it all starts from a ex-girlfriend, who has tastes for her physical living standard and broke up with me for many strange reasons. After I clam down and think it through, I know that the true reason is she just enlarge all the conflicts about the life styles on our both ends.

I think through my core values and found that I am not the guy who can live with high tastes but I truly know how to compose music, painting, make complex origami, websites and I like to absorb knowledge, meaning I have lots mentally but physically.

After researching lots of things, I think minimalist fits me well. Thank you, my ex-girlfriend, letting me to think about this issue.
