## Why?

Toefl

## How?

### Intonation

* rising tone
  * Yes/No Question
  * When there are still sentence to speak
* rise and down tone
  * to emphasize a word

### Task 1

* during preparation
  * Please memorize the template because I do not think we have time to write down template
  * read the question and write down the why; for example, lazy and then write down the example and then write down conclusion (effect)
* during speaking
  * In A/D questions, just need to speak out that `I agree or disagree the statement`
  * speak slowly
  * remember to speak the opposite example
  * try to paraphrase
  * think that you are talking to a person
  * conclusion should just use `That's way I think...`

### Task 2

Steps

* before reading
  * draw six grids and write down transition words
  * write template as follow: TBC
* When reading
  * decide university announces or student proposes
  * write down announcement or proposal (S.V.O)
  * write down the two reasons (S.V.O)
* When listening
  * decide the speaker agrees, disagrees, or has mixed feelings towards this UA or SP
  * write down the detail reason why the speaker agrees or disagrees
* When 30 secs preparation
  * decide transition words and restructure the sentences in 30 seconds preparation
  * mark intonations (to show attitude)
* When speaking
  * focus on fluency
  * focus on intonation
  * slow down

We can prepare the same test multiple times before we move on to other TPO questions.

### Task 3

Steps

* before reading
  * draw T
  * write down `the term, xxx, means, yyy. The professor gave several examples.`
  * write down `that's how the professor explained the term, xxx`
  * write template as follow: TBC
* when reading
  * write down topic, xxx
  * write down summary, yyy
    * scan keyword
    * write down the sentence explaining the keyword
* when listening
  * make sure how to spell the topic
  * write down as many S.V.O as possible to explain the term
* when preparing
  * read through the dropdown sentences and draw intonation to make sure we know where to emphasize
  * write down transition words

### Task 4

Steps: listening -> 20 seconds preparation -> 60 seconds answering

* before listening
  * draw T
  * write down the template

```HTML
Well, the professor illustrated the two reasons.

Okay. The first reason is (First Topic); for example, xxxxxxxx (lots of transition words, S.V.O). So, yyyyy (first conclusion)

The second reason is (Second Topic); for example, xxxxxxx (lots of transition words, S.V.O). So, yyyyyy (second conclusion)

And that's how the professor explained the two reasons.
```

* while listening
  * write down two topics
  * write down the examples: main idea -> detail -> conclusion
  * if there is weird word, make sure write down the spelling
* while preparing
  * write down transition words
  * read through the sentences and draw intonations
  * if not enough sentences, try to create more sentences by paraphrasing
* while speaking
  * slow down
  * intonations

## What?

### Task 2 practice

* Speed up notes taking
* Skim the announcement
* Make sure to restructure **all** sentences on note in 30 seconds preparation
* When we draw intonation, make sure to draw rising tone for key information and **each** sentence should have one
* university should use announcement

### Task 3 practice

* the speaking speed can be slower. take it easy
* make sure to drop intonation mark because it make sure we know the notes we are taking and where to emphasize for restructuring the thoughts
