## Introduction

quick explanation

## Why?

focus on why we need it

## How?

### Independent Writing

Steps

* After reading the question, find the main topic of this question and list three main aspects this topic cares based on the attitude and environment provided in this question
* think about or write down 6 points of each aspect to fill in the structure
  * positive example
    * (1) what it is
    * (2) details
    * (3) how large is the effect
  * negative example
    * (4) what it is
    * (5) details
    * (6) how large is the effect

#### the example six points

First of all, the government generally places emphasis on budget control (<- 1), and preserving old buildings can help it successfully save its budget. For instance, when the Taiwanese government decided to fix the Western wing of National Palace Museum, it only spent 20,000 US dollars to repair the ancient main entrance. Moreover, repainting the walls merely cost 1,000 US dollars. (<- 2) As a result, the government saved up to 50% of the original budget. (<- 3) on the other hand, if it decided to build a brand new monument, such as Taipei 101 (<- 4), it would have spent at least 1 million US dollars to import expensive materials from England. Furthermore, hiring workers and engineers would have easily amounted to 2 million US dollars. (<- 5) Apparently, the new project might have totally exceed the budget. (<- 6)

Question: Should xxx do yyy?

---

Find three aspects: (1), (2), (3)

---

People often possess different perspective on (yyy). As for me, I strongly argue that (xxx should do yyy).

First of all, xxx cares about (1) and yyy can help (1). For example, when xxx decides to do (1-1), xxx only needs to (1-2). As a result, (1-3). On the other hand, if xxx decides to (1-4), xxx will cost (1-5). Apparently, (1-6)

Secondly,...

Last but not least,...

In conclusion, the government obviously should preserve ancient buildings. After all, it seeks to controller the budget, preserve history, and gain higher reputation.
