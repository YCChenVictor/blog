## Introduction

This article describes the concept and techniques of Toefl reading as follow:

* Vocabulary
* Reference
* Lead Word/ Detail
* Rhetorical Purpose
* Paraphrase
* Sentence Insertion
* EXCEPT/NOT/LEAST
* Inference: author's purpose
* Summary

## Why?

Toefl

## How?

Steps to answer questions:

* draw template
* analyze question's category
* utilize answer strategy
* technique
  * skim: walk through passage and drop down conclusion note
  * scan: directly find the keyword

### Vocabulary

#### Category of Vocabulary

When the question asks the meaning of particular vocabulary

#### Steps to solve Vocabulary

* If this vocabulary is in subject of a sentence, check the prior sentence. If this vocabulary is in object of a sentence, check the laster sentence.
* Drop down key points of that checked sentence
* Choose answer based on key points

#### Example of Vocabulary Question

For example,

TBC

### Reference

#### Category of Reference

When pronoun

### Lead Word/ Detail

#### Category of Lead Word/ Detail

* When a question starts from 'according to'
* ends with 'which of the following'
* mentioned number of paragraph specifically

#### Steps to solve Lead Word/ Detail

* Find keyword in question
* Scan article to find the keyword
* drop the key point of that sentence containing the keyword. If no keyword in passage, drop the inference why author write this passage. (should drop v.o)
* choose the answer

For example,

TBC

### Rhetorical Purpose

#### Category of Rhetorical Purpose

* The author discusses X in paragraph 2 in order to...
* Why does the author mention X?
* The author uses X as an example of
* How is paragraph 3 organized?
* How is paragraph 1 and 2 related?

#### Steps to solve Rhetorical Purpose

Mindset: academic articles all have structure of main idea and then details.

* find where the key word in question is
* determine whether this sentence is main or detail
* If main, then the answer is in details and should summarize the details
* If detail, then the answer is in main and should summarize the main

#### Example of Rhetorical Purpose

For example,

TBC

### Paraphrase

#### type of paraphrase

It will highlight the sentences and ask us to paraphrase it

#### steps of paraphrase

* use sentence structure to find out the most important information
  * trim the sentence into S.V.O
  * and also get the attitude
* write down own idea
* choose the answer

### Sentence Insertion

#### Steps of Sentence Insertion

Steps:

* Decompose the sentence into prior information and later information
* Skim through the whole paragraph and find key words of each sentence
* Pair prior and later information to these key words. If these information matches the key words, then it is where to insert

For example, try to insert

**This economics reliance on livestock in certain regions makes large tracts of land susceptible to overgrazing.**

into

(A). The raising of livestock is a major economic activity in semiarid lands, where grasses are generally the dominant type of natural vegetation. (B). The consequences of an excessive number of livestock grazing in an area are the reduction of the vegetation cover and the trampling and pulverization of the soil. (C). This is usually followed by the drying of the soil and accelerated erosion. (D).

---

##### Step 1

prior information: economics reliance
later information: overgrazing

##### Step 2

(A) -> livestock -> economic -> (B) -> grazing -> vegetation, soil -> drying, erosion -> (D)

##### Step 3

Choose B

### EXCEPT/NOT question

#### Steps for EXCEPT/NOT

Steps

* If no impression, skim to understand the passage (drop down conclusion notes) and then scan options
* If having impression, scan the options
* mark the options as true or false

For example,

The cinema did not emerge as a form of mass consumption until its technology evolved from the initial 'peepshow' format to the point where images were projected on a screen in a darkened theater. In the peepshow format, a film was viewed through a small opening in a machine that was created for that purpose. Thomas Edison's peepshow device, the Kinetoscope, was introduced to the public in 1894. It was designed for use in Kinetoscope parlors, or arcades, which contained only a few individual machines and permitted only one customer to view a short, 50-foot film at any one time. The first Kinetoscope parlors contained five machines. For the price of 25 cents (or 5 cents per machine), customers moved from machine to machine to watch five different films (or, in the case of famous prizefights, successive rounds of a single fight).

and the question:

According the this paragraph, all of the following were true of viewing films in Kinetoscope parlors EXCEPT:

(A) One individual at a time viewed a film
(B) Customers could view one film after another
(C) Prizefights wre the most popular subject for films
(D) Each film was short

##### Step 1 (skim)

Draw rectangle and input the key point

##### Step 2 (scan)

Walk through the question and check T/F based on the passage

### Inference Question

#### Category of Inference

This kind of question is to infer why author write this passage.

#### Steps of Inference

Steps

* Skim the passage and drop key point
* Think why author wrote this passage and write down self inference
* Scan the options and eliminate the extreme answer

For example,

The extreme seriousness of desertification results from the vast areas of land and the tremendous numbers of people affected, as well as from the great difficulty of reversing or even slowing the process. Once the soil has been removed by erosion, only the passage of centuries or millennia will enable new soil to form. In areas where considerable soil still remains, though, a rigorously enforced program of land protection and over-crop planting may make it possible to reverse the present deterioration of the surface.

---

##### Step 1 for Inference Question

Skim and drop the notes: people, vast cause desertification (-) and to prevent them, we need protection and time

##### Step 2 for Inference Question

To appeal for actions to prevent deterioration

##### Step 3 for Inference Question

(A) Governments will act quickly to control further desertification (x, extreme)
(B) The factors influencing desertification occur in cycles and will change in the future (x, the factors are the same)
(C) Desertification will continue to increase (o, to appeal)
(D) Desertification will soon occur in all areas of the world (x, extreme)

### Summary Question

We need to select three summaries for this question

Steps

* Read first sentence and last sentence of first paragraph and last paragraph to drop down main idea and purpose
* read first sentence of other paragraph and drop down the key points
* remove options that are too detailed
* remove wrong inference options

For example,

TBC

## What?

### Vocabulary Review

* TPO 17 R1 (1):
  * impetus is in O: read the after sentence
  * summary after sentence: made the idea irresistible
  * so we should choose the one, promoting something
  * retrospect
    * not enough vocabulary size
    * but I get the right key point

### Lead Word/ Detail Review

* TPO 17 R1 (2):
  * keyword: new way -> last sentence
  * key point: maintain the traditional routes -> C or D
  * summary the paragraph -> political
  * retrospect
    * problem of overgeneralization in C -> costly
