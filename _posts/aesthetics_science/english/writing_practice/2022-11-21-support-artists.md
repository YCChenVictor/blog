Should the government support artist or should the artists support themselves?

People often possess different perspective on whether government should support artist or not. As for me, I strongly argue that the government should not support artists.

First of all, the government cares about budget and supporting artists will cost government lots of money. For example, when the government decides to give each artist 10 thousand NT Dollars each month, it cost for total 1 million NT Dollars. However, the artists can still produce no valuable arts, which worth more than 1 million NT Dollars a month on average. As a result, supporting artists can a unreturnable investment. On the other hand, if the artists support themselves, the government would not need to pay any cost. Moreover, those untalented artists will be selected out of market so that government can make sure only qualified artists in the country. Apparently, the not supporting artists can give better result for the government.

Secondly, the government usually focuses on votes and supporting artist may lose more votes. To be more specific, artists are the minority and the government can put more emphasis on welfare of majority, which can gain more votes with same efforts. On the contrary, if the government support (TBC)
