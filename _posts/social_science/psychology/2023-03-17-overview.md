## Introduction

This article describes my studies related to psychology.

## Why?

I want to understand myself and prepare for future studies.

## How?

### Developmental psychology

* Theory: Various factors, such as genetics, environment, culture, and social experiences can influence an individual's development
* Progress: Examining the physical, cognitive, emotional, and social changes that occur as individuals progress from infancy through childhood, adolescence, and adulthood
* Application

### Abnormal Psychology

* Application (Why)
  * Improve mental health and well-being
  * Address the social and cultural factors that contribute to the development and maintenance of mental health disorders
  * Reduce the stigma associated with mental illness
  * Promote greater understanding and acceptance of those who are affected by these conditions
* Process (How)
  * Study of mental health disorders and other forms of abnormal behavior
  * Examination of abnormal thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that deviate from what is considered normal or healthy, and the impact of these conditions on individuals, society, and culture
* Solution (What)
  * Assessment: Assess the individual's symptoms and identify the underlying causes of their condition. This may involve a comprehensive clinical interview, medical evaluations, and psychological tests.
  * Diagnosis: Make a formal diagnosis of the mental health disorder. This involves matching the individual's symptoms with the diagnostic criteria outlined in the DSM-5 or ICD-11.
  * Treatment planning: Develop a treatment plan that is tailored to the individual's specific needs and goals. This may involve a combination of medication, psychotherapy, and other forms of behavioral or cognitive interventions.
  * Treatment implementation: Implement the interventions outlined in the plan. This may involve regular therapy sessions, medication management, and other forms of treatment.
  * Monitoring and evaluation: Ensure that the interventions are effective and that the individual is making progress towards their goals.
  * Maintenance and follow-up: Once the individual's symptoms have improved and their mental health has stabilized, they will typically continue to receive ongoing care and support to maintain their progress and prevent relapse.

#### DSM-5 or ICD-11

* Identify Symptoms
  * Asking the individual questions about their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to gain a better understanding of their symptoms and how they are impacting their daily life (I should go to see the doctor)
  * Psychological testing: Professionals may also use psychological tests to identify symptoms and assess the individual's mental health. These tests may include personality assessments, intelligence tests, and symptom-specific questionnaires. (I can find some resources)
    * Personality tests: These tests are designed to assess an individual's personality traits, characteristics, and tendencies. Examples of personality tests include the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and the NEO Personality Inventory.
      * No MMPI free online
      * [NEO Personality Inventory result]({{site.baseurl}}/psychology/2023/03/26/NEO-result.html) (testometrika)
    * Intelligence tests: These tests are designed to assess an individual's cognitive abilities and intellectual potential. Examples of intelligence tests include the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale.
    * Neuropsychological tests: These tests are designed to assess an individual's cognitive function and neurological status. Examples of neuropsychological tests include the Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Battery and the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery.
    * Projective tests: These tests are designed to explore an individual's unconscious thoughts, emotions, and conflicts. Examples of projective tests include the Rorschach Inkblot Test and the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT).
  * Observation: Professionals may observe the individual's behavior and interactions with others to identify symptoms. This may involve observing the individual in a clinical setting or in their natural environment, such as at home or at work.
  * Medical evaluation: In some cases, professionals may conduct a medical evaluation to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the individual's symptoms.
  * Collaboration with other healthcare providers: Professionals may collaborate with other healthcare providers, such as primary care physicians, to identify symptoms and assess the individual's mental health.
* Match the symptoms to the diagnostic criteria: Once the presenting symptoms have been identified, the next step is to match them to the diagnostic criteria outlined in the DSM-5 or ICD-11. This involves comparing the individual's symptoms to the criteria for each mental health disorder to determine the most appropriate diagnosis.
* Consider comorbidities: In some cases, an individual may present with symptoms that meet the criteria for multiple mental health disorders. It is important to consider comorbidities and choose the diagnosis that best fits the individual's symptoms and overall presentation.
* Verify the diagnosis: After identifying the most appropriate diagnosis, it is important to verify it through additional assessment and evaluation. This may involve further psychological testing, medical evaluations, or consultations with other healthcare providers.
* Develop a treatment plan: Once a diagnosis has been made, the treatment team will develop a treatment plan that is tailored to the individual's specific needs and goals. This may involve a combination of medication, psychotherapy, and other forms of behavioral or cognitive interventions.

#### Subfields

* Subfields: mood disorders (such as depression and bipolar disorder), anxiety disorders (such as generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and phobias), personality disorders (such as borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder), and psychotic disorders (such as schizophrenia).
* Abnormal psychology also explores the factors that contribute to the development and maintenance of mental health disorders, including biological, environmental, and psychological factors. This field also examines the various treatments that are available for these conditions, including pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and other forms of behavioral and cognitive interventions.

#### Causes and treatments of anxiety disorders
#### Biological and environmental factors in schizophrenia
#### Personality disorders and their impact on relationships
#### Comorbidity between substance abuse and mental health disorders

### Neuropsychology

Neural basis of perception and cognition
Neuroplasticity and brain reorganization after injury or disease
Brain imaging techniques and their applications
Relationship between brain function and behavior

### Forensic psychology

### Resources of paper

Read research studies: Read studies published in academic journals to get a deeper understanding of the theories and concepts. You can find research studies on websites such as Google Scholar, PsycINFO, and PubMed.

### Resources of discussions

### Real World Problem

#### toxic relationship

* Study of behavior and mental processes that deviate from what is considered normal or healthy
* Subfields
  * Personality psychology focuses on understanding the characteristics that shape an individual's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, including those that may contribute to toxic behavior
  * Social psychology examines the influence of social context and relationships on behavior, which is important in understanding how toxic behavior can spread and affect others
  * Clinical psychology also plays a role, as it involves the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders that may contribute to toxic behavior.

### interest terminology

* Context Effect
  * Concept: The context in which a stimulus is presented can significantly affect how we perceive and evaluate it. It highlights the importance of considering the context in which information is presented and the potential biases that can arise from it.
  * Example: Imagine you are shown a gray square on a white background. Then, you are shown the same gray square on a black background. Even though the physical characteristics of the square have not changed, your perception of its brightness and color may be influenced by the background.
* Heuristics
  * Concept: Make decisions or solve problems quickly and efficiently, without necessarily relying on logical or analytical thinking. While heuristics can be useful in many situations, they can also lead to errors or biases if they are applied too rigidly or without careful consideration of the specific context.
  * Example
    * Availability heuristic: The tendency to judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily examples of similar events come to mind. For example, people might overestimate the risk of shark attacks because they are more memorable than other, more common risks like car accidents.
    * Representativeness heuristic: This is the tendency to make judgments about the likelihood of an event based on how closely it resembles other events we know about. For example, people might assume that someone who wears glasses and reads a lot must be a university professor, even if that's not the case.
    * Anchoring and adjustment heuristic: This is the tendency to use an initial value (the "anchor") as a starting point for estimating a quantity, and then adjusting that estimate based on additional information. For example, people might be more likely to pay a high price for a product if the seller starts with a very high initial price, even if that price is arbitrary.
    * Recognition heuristic: This is the tendency to judge the value or importance of something based on how familiar it is. For example, people might assume that a well-known brand is better than a lesser-known one, even if they have no other information.
