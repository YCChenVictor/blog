### interest terminology

* Context Effect
  * Concept: The context in which a stimulus is presented can significantly affect how we perceive and evaluate it. It highlights the importance of considering the context in which information is presented and the potential biases that can arise from it.
  * Example: Imagine you are shown a gray square on a white background. Then, you are shown the same gray square on a black background. Even though the physical characteristics of the square have not changed, your perception of its brightness and color may be influenced by the background.
* Heuristics
  * Concept: Make decisions or solve problems quickly and efficiently, without necessarily relying on logical or analytical thinking. While heuristics can be useful in many situations, they can also lead to errors or biases if they are applied too rigidly or without careful consideration of the specific context.
  * Example
    * Availability heuristic: The tendency to judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily examples of similar events come to mind. For example, people might overestimate the risk of shark attacks because they are more memorable than other, more common risks like car accidents.
    * Representativeness heuristic: This is the tendency to make judgments about the likelihood of an event based on how closely it resembles other events we know about. For example, people might assume that someone who wears glasses and reads a lot must be a university professor, even if that's not the case.
    * Anchoring and adjustment heuristic: This is the tendency to use an initial value (the "anchor") as a starting point for estimating a quantity, and then adjusting that estimate based on additional information. For example, people might be more likely to pay a high price for a product if the seller starts with a very high initial price, even if that price is arbitrary.
    * Recognition heuristic: This is the tendency to judge the value or importance of something based on how familiar it is. For example, people might assume that a well-known brand is better than a lesser-known one, even if they have no other information.
