## Introduction

## Why

## How

### basic

REST means Representational State Transfer. The benefit of RESTful API is unity. All programmers have the consensus to write it in the same form. The direct implementation in rails is to use `resources` method as follow:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/1_qGzuUl1QZXrzLIrEjFjV1A.png" alt="">

```bash
rails routes
```

the results: (8 routes related to users)
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/1__ZNgXbOxIkg0wSKGXm8aDCw.png" alt="">

We can use `only` or `except` to set the only routes we need

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do  
  resources :products, only: [:index, :show]
  # or the following codes
  # resources :products, except: [:new, :create, :edit, :update, :destroy]
end
```

we can use `collection` and `member` to add sub layer for more manipulation; for example,

### collection

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do  
  resources :orders do  
    collection do  
      get :cancelled  
    end  
  end  
end
```

Then the routes:
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/1_YTaNYTwb6aA41Ukylqj-og.png" alt="">

There is one more route: `cancelled_orders`

### member



### member vs collection

```ruby
member: xxx/id/xxx

collection: xxx/xxx
```

### specify routes name

we can specify routes name for administration; for example `asdfadfaew`

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do  
  namespace :admin, path: "asdfadfaew" do  
    resources :products  
  end
end
```

Then the route path would be as follow:
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/1_a0_F4MMPrazMJ8PGeD7CGg.png" alt="">

There is will be `/asdfadfaew/…` routes

After the route, let’s start to explore controller.
