## Introduction

* A model is a Ruby class that is used to represent data. Additionally, models can interact with the application's database through a feature of Rails called [Active Record]({{site.baseurl}}/rails/2021/06/10/active-record.html)
* An object refers to an instance of a class, which represents a single record in a database table.

In this article, I am not going to research how rails code methods in model, so in how section will be basic coding examples for me to understand the concepts. Please refer to [Active Record]({{site.baseurl}}/rails/2021/06/10/active-record.html) to see how rails code the default model methods.

## Why

With model, we can use consistent commands to communicate with all type of databases such as MySQL, Postgresql, …etc.

## How

### Create One

Define a Ruby class that inherits from the ActiveRecord::Base class. This class will represent a table in your database, and the properties of the class will map to columns in the table. Here is an example:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

In this example, we have defined a `User` class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Base`. This class will represent a table called users in our database (convention), and it will have properties that map to columns in the users table.

Then we can interact with database with this model:

* Creating a new record

```ruby
user = User.new(name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com')
user.save
```

In this example, we create a new User record by creating a new instance of the User class and setting its properties. We then call the save method on the instance to save it to the database.

* Updating a record

```ruby
user = User.find_by(name: 'John')
user.email = 'new_email@example.com'
user.save
```

In this example, we find an existing User record by querying the database for a record with a name of 'John'. We then update the email property of the record and save the changes to the database.

* Querying records

```ruby
users = User.where(age: 18..35)
```

In this example, we use the where method on the User class to query the database for all User records with an age between 18 and 35. The result of the query is a collection of User instances that match the criteria.

### relation

* belongs_to: Used to define a one-to-many relationship between two tables
* has_many: Used to define a one-to-many relationship between two tables
* has_one: Used to define a one-to-one relationship between two tables
* example: We have a User model, a Profile model, and a Post model. Each user has one profile, and each user can have many posts. Each post belongs to a user.

To define these associations,

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :profile
  has_many :posts
end

class Profile < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
end

class Post < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  has_one :profile, through: :user # because user has one profile and also has many posts
end
```

This tells Rails that each User has one Profile, and that each User can have many Posts. It also tells Rails that each Profile belongs to a User, and that each Post belongs to a User. By default, Rails assumes that the posts table has a foreign key called user_id that references the id column of the users table.

Access related data:

```ruby
@user = User.find(params[:id])
@profile = @user.profile

@user = User.find(params[:id])
@posts = @user.posts

@post = Post.find(params[:id])
@user = @post.user

@post = Post.find(params[:id])
@profile = @post.profile
```

### validation

* Validations help ensure that the data is accurate, consistent, and secure.
* Built-in validation helpers
  * presence: Validates that the specified attributes are not empty.
  * uniqueness: Validates that the specified attributes are unique.
  * length: Validates the length of the specified attributes.
  * format: Validates that the specified attributes match a specified regular expression pattern.
  * numericality: Validates that the specified attributes are numeric.
* code example:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true, length: { minimum: 2 }
  validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true, format: { with: /\A[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\z/ }
  validates :age, numericality: { only_integer: true, greater_than: 0, less_than: 150 }
end
```

* If any of these validations fail, Rails will prevent the model from being saved to the database and add an error message to the corresponding attribute.
* It's important to note that validations only apply when creating or updating records through Active Record. If you're updating records through SQL, validations won't be checked.
* If you're performing bulk updates, such as with update_all, validations won't be checked either.

### callback

The full life cycle of an object in rails:

* Initialization: The object is created in memory with default attribute values.
* before_validation: Called before validation occurs.
* Validation: The object's attributes are validated to ensure they meet specified constraints or requirements.
* after_validation: Called after validation occurs.
* before_save: Called before the object is saved.
* Database write: The object's attributes are written to the database.
* around_save: Called around the object save.
* after_save: Called after the object is saved.
* before_create: Called before a new record is created.
* around_create: Called around a new record creation.
* after_create: Called after a new record is created.
* before_update: Called before an existing record is updated.
* around_update: Called around an existing record update.
* after_update: Called after an existing record is updated.
* before_destroy: Called before a record is destroyed.
* around_destroy: Called around a record destruction.
* after_destroy: Called after a record is destroyed.

Not all steps of the lifecycle are always executed. For example, if an object fails validation, the before_save, around_save, after_save, before_create, around_create, and after_create callbacks won't be executed.

* coding example

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  before_save :normalize_name
  after_create :send_welcome_email

  private

  def normalize_name
    self.name = name.downcase.titleize
  end

  def send_welcome_email
    UserMailer.welcome_email(self).deliver_now
  end
end
```

### scope

Scopes are defined as class methods on a model and return a relation object, which can be further chained with other query methods to narrow down the results.

```ruby
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  scope :available, -> { where(in_stock: true) }
  scope :priced_above, ->(price) { where('price > ?', price) }
end

# Retrieve all available products
Product.available

# Retrieve all products priced above $50
Product.priced_above(50)

# Combine scopes with other query methods
Product.available.priced_above(50)
```

## What

### real world example

E-commerce application:

* three models
  * Product: The Product model represents a specific item that can be sold on the website
  * Order: The Order model represents a single order that a customer has placed on the website.
  * LineItem: The LineItem model represents a specific item that a customer has added to their cart while shopping.
* A Product can have many LineItems, and a LineItem belongs to a Product and an Order. An Order can have many LineItems.
* settings:
  * Product
    * If a Product is destroyed, all its associated LineItems should be destroyed too
    * Validation that requires name and price to be present.
  * Order
    * If an Order is destroyed, all its associated LineItems should be destroyed too. * Validations that require name and email to be present
    * Callback that set the initial status of the Order to "pending"
    * Callback to update the subtotal of the Order whenever a LineItem is saved.

```ruby
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :line_items, dependent: :destroy
  validates :name, :price, presence: true
end

class Order < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :line_items, dependent: :destroy
  validates :name, :email, presence: true
  before_create :set_order_status
  before_save :update_subtotal

  def subtotal
    line_items.map(&:total_price).sum
  end

  private

  def set_order_status
    self.status = 'pending'
  end

  def update_subtotal
    self[:subtotal] = subtotal
  end
end

class LineItem < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :product
  belongs_to :order, optional: true
  validates :product_id, presence: true
  validates :quantity, numericality: { only_integer: true, greater_than: 0 }

  def total_price
    product.price * quantity
  end
end
```

In the LineItem model, we define a belongs_to association with Product and Order. We also add two validations that require the product_id to be present and the quantity to be greater than zero, as well as a method that calculates the total price of the line item.

With these relationships, validations, and callbacks in place, we can easily create, update, and delete products, orders, and line items in our e-commerce application.
