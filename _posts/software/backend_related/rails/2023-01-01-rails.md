## Introduction

This article is going to build a website quickly

* Open-source web application framework in the Ruby
* Follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern
  * Model, representing the data and logic of the application
  * View, providing the user interface
  * Controller, handling user input and interacts with the model and view
* Make programming web applications easier by providing a set of conventions and abstractions that eliminate much of the repetitive work involved in building web applications from scratch
  * ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system for interacting with databases
  * Routing system for handling incoming requests
  * Testing framework for writing automated tests
* Convention over configuration, which means that it comes with sensible defaults and assumptions that can be overridden if necessary, but in general, makes it easier for developers to get started quickly and focus on building their application logic rather than configuring the framework
* Rails has a large and active community of developers and contributors, which means that there are many resources available for learning and troubleshooting, as well as a wide range of third-party plugins and libraries that can be used to extend its functionality.

## Why?

* Convention over Configuration: Help you get started quickly and focus on building your application logic instead of configuring the framework.
* Rapid Development: Rails is designed to make development fast and easy, with features like scaffolding, which generates boilerplate code for you.
* Rails community: has created a vast ecosystem of gems (libraries) that can be easily integrated into your application.
* Full-stack framework: Rails is a full-stack framework that includes an ORM (ActiveRecord) for database access, routing, middleware, and a view layer (ActionView) for rendering HTML. This means that you can build a complete web application using just Rails.
* Mature framework: Rails has been around since 2004 and has a large community of developers contributing to its development. This means that it has a large number of plugins, tools, and resources available, as well as a large pool of experienced developers who can help you troubleshoot issues.
* Ruby language: Rails is built on the Ruby programming language, which is known for its simplicity and readability

## How?

### init

* install: `gem install rails`
  * check version: `rails -v`
* build project: `bundle install`
* start project: `rails new app_name`
* start server: `rails s`

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/rails_server_start.png" alt="rails_server_start">

open browsers and input `http://localhost:3000`

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/rails_start_page.png" alt="rails_start_page">

### scaffold

Scaffold in rails is a quick way to create MVC structure; for example, if you want to create a MVC structure with database, user (name:string, email:string, tel:string), in the directory of the project,

``` bash
rails g scaffold User name:string email:string tel:string
```
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/files_created_by_scaffold.png" alt="">

As you can see, there are files for `active_record`, `resource_route`, `scaffold_controller`, `test_unit`, `assets`, `scss`.

### routes

With scaffold, it will help us add code as follow:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :users
  # For details on the DSL available within this file, see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
end
```

* RESTful API: REST means Representational State Transfer. The benefit of RESTful API is unity. All coders have the consensus to write it in the same form; for example, given `resources :users` and input `rails routes`, the routes:

| Prefix | Verb | URI Pattern | Controller#Action |
| :-----: | :-: | :-: |
| users | GET | /users(.:format) | users#index |
|  | POST | /users(.:format) | users#create |
| new_user | GET | /users/new(.:format) | users#new |
| edit_user | GET | /users/:id/edit(.:format) | users#edit |
| user | GET | /users/:id(.:format) | users#show |
|  | PATCH | /users/:id(.:format) | users#update |
|  | PUT | /users/:id(.:format) | users#update |
|  | DELETE | /users/:id(.:format) | users#destroy |

As you can see, there are four verbs following RESTful, `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, directed to the CRUD methods of controller and the controller call the corresponding CRUD methods to database. Actually, `GET` maps READ, `POST` maps CREATE, `PATCH` maps UPDATE, `DELETE` maps DESTROY.

For more information, please refer to [routes]({{site.baseurl}}/rails/2022/02/05/Routes.html)

### model

Models are in `app/models`. file name: `user.rb` maps class `User` and maps table `users`.

For more information, please refer to [model]({{site.baseurl}}/rails/2021/03/02/model.html)

### view

Views are in `app/views`. For example, the view file related to controller, `UserController` will be in `app/views/users` as follow:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/view_user_index.png" alt="">

For more information, please refer to [view]({{site.baseurl}}/rails/2021/03/02/view.html)

### controller

Controllers are in `app/controllers`. The file names and the controller names are linked; for example, file name: `users_controller.rb` maps class, `UserController` as follow:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/user_controller.png" alt="">

For more information, please refer to [controller]({{site.baseurl}}/rails/2022/02/06/Controller.html)

### API

API mode is a feature in Rails 6 that provides a stripped-down version of Rails optimized for building API-only applications. It removes or disables certain features that are specific to web applications, making the stack leaner and faster. For more information, please refer to [api mode]({{site.baseurl}}/rails/2021/03/22/api-mode.html)

### ORM

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a technique or library that allows developers to map database tables to classes, and vice versa, so that they can interact with the database using object-oriented programming. The ORM abstracts away the SQL code and provides a higher-level API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records from the database. For more information, please refer to [ORM]({{site.baseurl}}/rails/2022/01/13/object-relational-mapping.html)

### ORM vs Model

A model and an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) are two different concepts in software development, but they are related to each other.

A model is a representation of data that defines the structure, behavior, and relationships of that data in a software system. In other words, a model is an abstraction of the real-world entities that a software system deals with. Models can be implemented using different programming languages, frameworks, or libraries.

On the other hand, an ORM is a technique or a library that allows developers to map database tables to classes, and vice versa, so that they can interact with the database using object-oriented programming. The ORM abstracts away the SQL code and provides a higher-level API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records from the database. The ORM also handles the conversion between object data types and database data types.

### database

[database]({{site.baseurl}}/rails/2023/03/28/database.html)

### rspec and capybara

We can also use rspec and capybara to compose test for this app (to be continued)

For more information, please refer to [rspec and capybara]({{site.baseurl}}/test/2022/08/31/rspec-and-capybara.html)

### test driven development

We can write the spec first and keep running the specs to development this app completely.

(compose spec here)

For more information, please refer to [test driven development]({{site.baseurl}}/test/2021/04/06/test-driven-development.html)
