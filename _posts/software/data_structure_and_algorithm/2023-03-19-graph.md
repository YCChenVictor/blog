## Introduction

This article discusses the usefulness of graphs for visually representing relationships and connections between data points, as well as various applications of graph algorithms, including modeling real-world problems, analyzing software dependencies, and optimizing code. It also provides an overview of important graph terminology, such as vertices and edges, and presents code examples for implementing graph algorithms such as depth-first search and breadth-first search.

## Why?

Graphs are useful for visually representing relationships and connections between data points, making it easier to identify patterns and insights.

## How?

### Visualization

<div class="mermaid">

    id1((0)) --- id2((1))
    id4((3)) --- id2((1))
    id4((3)) --- id3((2))
    id1((0)) --- id4((3))

### terminology

* Vertices
  * Concept: Represent the objects or entities being modeled
  * Example: The nodes with naming, 1, 2, 3, 4
* Edges
  * Concept: Edges represent the relationships or connections between those objects. Edges can be directed or undirected, and can have weights or costs associated with them to represent the strength or importance of the relationship between vertices
  * Example: The lines connect the vertices
* Representation
  * Represented using various data structures, such as adjacency matrices, adjacency lists, and edge lists
* Other
  * Self loop: the edge from a vertex to itself

### Representation

(to be continued)

compare Adjacency matrices, Adjacency lists, and Edge lists

I prefer adjacency lists

refer to [here](https://medium.com/basecs/from-theory-to-practice-representing-graphs-cfd782c5be38)

### Basic Form

Here will compose a class of adjacency lists 

* Basic structure (based on visualization)
  ```javascript
  const graph = { // adjacency lists
    0: [1, 2],
    1: [0, 1, 3],
    2: [0, 3],
    3: [0, 1, 2]
  };
  ```
* Code example
  ```javascript
  class Graph {
    constructor() {
      this.vertices = new Map();
    }
  
    addVertex(vertex) {
      this.vertices.set(vertex, []);
    }
  
    addEdge(vertex1, vertex2) {
      this.vertices.get(vertex1).push(vertex2);
      this.vertices.get(vertex2).push(vertex1);
    }
  
    getNeighbors(vertex) {
      return this.vertices.get(vertex);
    }

    removeVertex() {
      
    }

    removeEdge() {

    }
  }
  ```
* spec
  ```javascript
  describe('Graph', () => {
    test('#init', () => {
      testGraph = new Graph();
      [0, 1, 2, 3].forEach(node => testGraph.addVertex(node));
      [[1, 2], [1, 4], [2, 4]].forEach(edge => testGraph.addEdge(edge[0], edge[1]))
      expect(testGraph.getNeighbors(1)).toEqual([2, 4]);
      expect(testGraph.getNeighbors(2)).toEqual([1, 4]);
      expect(testGraph.getNeighbors(3)).toEqual([]);
      expect(testGraph.getNeighbors(4)).toEqual([1, 2]);
    })
  })
  ```
* Time complexity
  * Adding a vertex: O(1) (constant time)
  * Adding an edge: O(1) (constant time)
  * Removing a vertex: O(V + E) (linear time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges)
  * Removing an edge: O(1) (constant time)
  * Finding a vertex: O(V) (linear time)
  * Finding an edge: O(E) (linear time)

### Traversal Algorithm

* code example
  ```javascript
  class Graph {
    constructor() {
      this.vertices = new Map();
    }
  
    addVertex(vertex) {
      this.vertices.set(vertex, []);
    }
  
    addEdge(vertex1, vertex2) {
      this.vertices.get(vertex1).push(vertex2);
      this.vertices.get(vertex2).push(vertex1);
    }
  
    getNeighbors(vertex) {
      return this.vertices.get(vertex);
    }
  
    depthFirstSearch(vertex, visited = new Set()) {
      visited.add(vertex);
      this.getNeighbors(vertex).forEach(neighbor => {
        if(!visited.has(neighbor)) {
          this.depthFirstSearch(neighbor, visited)
        }
      })
      return visited
    }
    
    breadthFirstSearch(startingVertex) {
      const queue = [startingVertex];
      const visited = new Set([startingVertex]);
  
      while (queue.length) {
        const currentVertex = queue.shift();
        const neighbors = this.getNeighbors(currentVertex);
    
        for (let neighbor of neighbors) {
          if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
            visited.add(neighbor);
            queue.push(neighbor);
          }
        }
      }
      
      return visited;
    }
  }
  
  module.exports = Graph;
  ```
* DFS (depth first search)
  * Application
    * Find paths between two vertices
    * detecting cycles in a graph
    * determining whether a graph is bipartite
  * Solution: Visits each node exactly once and records the path it takes to reach each node. The algorithm can be implemented recursively or iteratively using a stack.
  * Concept: Follow a path as far as possible before **backtracking and exploring** other paths. This means that DFS explores the deepest possible path in the graph before backtracking, hence the name "depth-first"
  * Intuition: Have a look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fujbpJ0LB4)
* BFS (breath first search)
  * Application: Finding the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph, Finding all the nodes that are at a certain distance from a given node, Checking for the existence of a path between two nodes in a graph
  * Solution: Uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be explored. It starts by adding the starting node to the queue and marking it as visited. Then, it dequeues the node at the front of the queue, visits its neighbors, and enqueues them if they haven't been visited yet. This process continues until all the nodes have been visited.
  * Concept: Starts at a node and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to next level neighbors.
  * Intuition: Have a look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDqjPvD54Ss&t=85s)
* DFS vs BFS
  * BFS: Preferred for finding the shortest path between two nodes or when you need to visit all nodes at a certain distance from a given node. BFS explores nodes in a breadth-first manner, which means that it will always visit nodes at a shorter distance before moving on to nodes at a greater distance. This property makes it well-suited for finding the shortest path.
  * DFS: Preferred for exploring all nodes in a graph or when you need to detect cycles in a graph. DFS explores nodes in a depth-first manner, which means that it will always go as far as possible down one branch before backtracking and exploring other branches. This property makes it well-suited for exploring all nodes in a graph.
* time complexity
  * Depth-first search: O(V + E) (linear time)
  * Breadth-first search: O(V + E) (linear time)
  * V? E?
* spec
  ```javascript
  const Graph = require('../examples/graph.js');
  
  describe('Graph', () => {
    test('#init', () => {
      testGraph = new Graph();
      [1, 2, 3, 4].forEach(node => testGraph.addVertex(node));
      [[1, 2], [1, 4], [2, 4]].forEach(edge => testGraph.addEdge(edge[0], edge[1]))
      expect(testGraph.getNeighbors(1)).toEqual([2, 4]);
      expect(testGraph.getNeighbors(2)).toEqual([1, 4]);
      expect(testGraph.getNeighbors(3)).toEqual([]);
      expect(testGraph.getNeighbors(4)).toEqual([1, 2]);
    })
  
    test('DFS', () => {
      testGraph = new Graph();
      expectSet = new Set(['A', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'C']);
      ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'].forEach(node => testGraph.addVertex(node));
      [['A', 'B'], ['A', 'C'], ['B', 'D'], ['B', 'E'], ['C', 'F'], ['E', 'F']].forEach(edge => testGraph.addEdge(edge[0], edge[1]))
      expect(testGraph.depthFirstSearch('A')).toEqual(expectSet);
    })
  
    test('BFS', () => {
      testGraph = new Graph();
      expectSet = new Set(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']);
      ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'].forEach(node => testGraph.addVertex(node));
      [['A', 'B'], ['A', 'C'], ['B', 'D'], ['B', 'E'], ['C', 'F'], ['E', 'F']].forEach(edge => testGraph.addEdge(edge[0], edge[1]))
      expect(testGraph.breadthFirstSearch('A')).toEqual(expectSet);
    })
  })
  ```

### Dijkstra's algorithm

### time complexity

* Shortest path (Dijkstra's algorithm): O((V + E) * log V) (where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges)
* Minimum spanning tree (Prim's algorithm): O((V + E) * log V) (where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges)

### Route Between Nodes

### Build Order

## What?

### Maze

* Try to find the shortest path in maze with DFS
* Represent maze as a graph, each cell is a node and the neighboring cells are connected by edges
* Use a depth-first search algorithm to explore all possible paths from the starting cell to the exit cell. We can mark each cell as visited as we explore the maze and keep track of the shortest path we've found so far. Once we reach the exit cell, we compare the length of the path we've found to the shortest path so far and update it if the new path is shorter.
* This approach can be optimized using techniques such as backtracking and memoization to avoid exploring paths that cannot lead to the shortest path.
