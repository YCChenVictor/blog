## Introduction

(TBC)

## Why?

Learning sorting algorithms is essential for developers as it equips them with the ability to efficiently organize and manipulate data, leading to improved code performance and problem-solving capabilities in various software development scenarios.

## How?

All the purposes of sorting methods are to arrange a collection of items in a specific order, typically ascending or descending, to make it easier to search, retrieve, or analyze the data.

### Bubble Sort

* Concept: Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, "bubbling" the largest (or smallest) element to the end (or beginning) of the list, until the entire list is sorted.
* Example: Sort [5, 2, 8, 1, 4]
  * Step 1: Compares 5 and 2. Since 5 is greater than 2, they are swapped, resulting in [2, 5, 8, 1, 4]
  * Step 2: Compare 5 and 8. Since 5 is smaller than 8, nothing happened.
  * Step 3: Compare 8 and 1. Since 8 is greater than 1, they are swapped, resulting in [2, 5, 1, 8, 4]
  * Step 4: Compare 8 and 4. Since 8 is greater than 4, they are swapped, resulting in [2, 5, 1, 4, 8]
  * After the first pass, the largest number has "bubbled" to the end of the list. And we do the same thing again and again ([2, 5, 1, 4, 8] => [2, 1, 4, 5, 8] => [1, 2, 4, 5, 8])
* Time complexity: $$O(n^2)$$
  * Because (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 1 = (1 + (n-1)) * (n-1) / 2
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
  * We only need a space to store the element going to be swap
* Code:
  ```javascript
  function bubbleSort(arr) {
    var len = arr.length;
    for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      for (var j = 0; j < len - 1 - i; j++) {
        if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
          var temp = arr[j + 1];
          arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
          arr[j] = temp;
        }
      }
    }
    return arr;
  }
  ```

### Selection Sort

* Concept: Find the smallest (or largest) element in each iteration and swapping it with the element at the beginning of the unsorted portion until the entire list is sorted.
* Example: Sort [5, 2, 8, 1, 4]
  * Step 1: Find out the smallest element is 1 and swap it with first element => [1, 2, 8, 5, 4], time complexity = O(n)
  * Step 2: Find out the smallest element is 2 and swap it with second element => [1, 2, 8, 5, 4], time complexity = O(n - 1)
  * And the same logic => [1, 2, 4, 5, 8], time complexity = O(n - 2)
  * Same logic => [1, 2, 4, 5, 8], time complexity = O(n - 3)
  * Same logic => [1, 2, 4, 5, 8], time complexity = O(n - 4)
* Time complexity: $$O(n^2)$$
  * Because (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 1 = (1 + (n-1)) * (n-1) / 2
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
  * We only need a space to store the element going to be swap
* Code:
  ```javascript
  function selectionSort(arr) {
    var len = arr.length;
    for (var i = 0; i < len - 1; i++) {
      var minIndex = i;
      for (var j = i + 1; j < len; j++) {
        if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
          minIndex = j; // you still need to compare the min value even if it is in correct position
        }
      }
      if (minIndex !== i) { // we do not need the swap when it is already in correct position
        var temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[minIndex];
        arr[minIndex] = temp;
      }
    }
    return arr;
  }
  ```

### Merge Sort

* Concept: Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and then merges the sorted subarrays to produce a sorted array.
* Example: Sort [8, 3, 5, 1, 9, 2]
  * Step 1: Recursively divide array into halves until it is a base example: [8], [3], [5], [1], [9], [2].
    <div class="mermaid">
      graph TD
        id1((8, 3, 5, 1, 9, 2)) --> id2((8, 3, 5))
        id1((8, 3, 5, 1, 9, 2)) --> id3((1, 9, 2))

        id2((8, 3, 5)) --> id4((8, 3))
        id2((8, 3, 5)) --> id5((5))
      
        id3((1, 9, 2)) --> id6((1, 9))
        id3((1, 9, 2)) --> id7((2))

        id4((8, 3)) --> id8((8))
        id4((8, 3)) --> id9((3))

        id6((1, 9)) --> id10((1))
        id6((1, 9)) --> id11((9))
    </div>
  * Step 2: Merge the individual elements in sorted order => [3, 8], [5], [1, 9], [2]
  * Step 3: Again => [3, 5, 8], [1, 2, 9]
  * Step 4: Again => [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]
* Time complexity
  * n * log(n)
  * As you can see on the above graph, given the split process, the number of layer is always $$log_2N$$ and in each layer, we walk through n elements to make comparison and compose the result array.
* Space complexity: TBC
* Code
  ```javascript
  function mergeSort(arr) {
    if (arr.length <= 1) {
      return arr; // Base case: array is already sorted or empty
    }
    
    // Divide the array into two halves
    const middle = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
    const leftHalf = arr.slice(0, middle);
    const rightHalf = arr.slice(middle);
    
    // Recursively sort the two halves
    const sortedLeft = mergeSort(leftHalf);
    const sortedRight = mergeSort(rightHalf);
    
    result = merge(sortedLeft, sortedRight);
    // Merge the sorted halves
    return result
  }
  
  function merge(leftArr, rightArr) {
    let merged = [];
    let leftIdx = 0;
    let rightIdx = 0;

    // Compare elements from the left and right arrays
    while (leftIdx < leftArr.length && rightIdx < rightArr.length) {
      if (leftArr[leftIdx] < rightArr[rightIdx]) {
        merged.push(leftArr[leftIdx]);
        leftIdx++;
      } else {
        merged.push(rightArr[rightIdx]);
        rightIdx++;
      }
    }
    
    // Add any remaining elements from the left or right array
    while (leftIdx < leftArr.length) {
      merged.push(leftArr[leftIdx]);
      leftIdx++;
    }
    
    while (rightIdx < rightArr.length) {
      merged.push(rightArr[rightIdx]);
      rightIdx++;
    }
    
    return merged;
  }
  
  // Example usage:
  const arr = [8, 3, 1, 5, 2, 9, 4, 7, 6];
  const sortedArr = mergeSort(arr);
  console.log(sortedArr); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
  ```

### Quick Sort

Quick sort is a widely used sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two subarrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The process is then recursively applied to the subarrays until the entire array is sorted. For more information, please refer to [quick sort]({{site.baseurl}}/dsa/2023/06/02/quick-sort.html)

### Binary Search

Ok, after we sort an array we usually use binary search.

* Concept: Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that efficiently searches for a target value in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.
* Example:
  <div class="mermaid">
    graph TD
      id1((1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9)) --> id2((1, 2, 3))
      id1((1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9)) --> id3((5, 8, 9))

      id2((1, 2, 3)) --> id4((1, 2))
      id2((1, 2, 3)) --> id5((3))
      
      id3((5, 8, 9)) --> id6((5, 8))
      id3((5, 8, 9)) --> id7((9))

      id4((1, 2)) --> id8((1))
      id4((1, 2)) --> id9((2))

      id6((5, 8)) --> id10((5))
      id6((5, 8)) --> id11((8))
  </div>
* Time complexity
  * It is $$O(logN)$$
  * As you can see, we at most to walk through $$log_2N$$ elements to find the desired value

## What?

### E-commerce websites

Sorting algorithms are used to sort products on e-commerce websites based on price, popularity, ratings, and other criteria. The specific algorithm used by sort() varies depending on the JavaScript engine and environment. It commonly utilizes a variation of QuickSort.

```javascript
// An array of objects representing shoes
const shoes = [
  { name: "Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 38", price: 110, popularity: 8 },
  { name: "Adidas Ultraboost 21", price: 180, popularity: 9 },
  { name: "New Balance Fresh Foam 1080v11", price: 150, popularity: 7 },
  { name: "Brooks Ghost 14", price: 130, popularity: 6 },
  { name: "Hoka One One Bondi 7", price: 150, popularity: 8 }
];

// Sort the shoes by price in ascending order
shoes.sort(function(a, b) {
  return a.price - b.price;
});

// Output: 
// [
//   { name: "Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 38", price: 110, popularity: 8 },
//   { name: "Brooks Ghost 14", price: 130, popularity: 6 },
//   { name: "New Balance Fresh Foam 1080v11", price: 150, popularity: 7 },
//   { name: "Hoka One One Bondi 7", price: 150, popularity: 8 },
//   { name: "Adidas Ultraboost 21", price: 180, popularity: 9 }
// ]
```
