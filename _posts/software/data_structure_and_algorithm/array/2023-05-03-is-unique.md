## Why?

focus on why we need it

## How?

### Is Unique (string)

#### BUD

* Question: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters
* Brute force:

```javascript
s = 'example'
function charactersIsUnique(s) {
  if(typeof s != 'string') {
    return 'type error';
  }
  for (var i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < s.length; i++) {
      if (s[i] == s[j]) {
        return 'not unique'
      } else {
        continue;
      }
    }
  }
  return 'unique'
}

charactersIsUnique(s)
```

The above code is brute force solution with edge case considered. The time complexity = $$O(N^2)$$

* unncessary work: actually, for any character, we only need to compare the characters on their right-hand side, so we can rewrite it as follow:

```javascript
s = 'example'
function charactersIsUnique(s) {
  if(typeof s != 'string') {
    return 'type error'
  }
  for (var i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    for (var j = i+1; j < s.length; i++) {
      if (s[i] == s[j]) {
        return 'not unique'
      } else {
        continue;
      }
    }
  }
  return 'unique'
}

charactersIsUnique(s)
```

Then the number of times will be $$N + (N-1) + ... + 1 = N(1+N)/2$$; however, the time complexity is still $$O(N^2)$$

* Bottleneck: the place with highest time complexity is the nested for loops, so we should try to use only one for loop. What we can do here is use a hash as follow:

```javascript
string = 'example'
function charactersIsUnique(s) {
  object = {}
  if(typeof s != 'string') {
    return 'wrong type'
  }
  for (var i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if(object.hasOwnProperty(s[i])) {
      return 'not unique'
    } else {
      object[s[i]] = 1
    }
  }
  return 'unique'
}

charactersIsUnique(s)
```

Then the time complexity reduces to $$O(N)$$

#### real world example

Let's say we have a stack of test papers and teacher wants to find the students with same name to make sure there is no mistake when we record the scores. What the teacher may do are
1. take notes of all the names walked through and check it first every next student comes (like the example above)
2. sort the papers with the order of names and it is easy to find out duplicate names. (check the [sorting section]({{site.baseurl}}/dsa/2023/03/09/sorting.html)) But actually there is no sorting method lower or equal to O(N)

#### general solution

I think the solution above is general enough

#### stack up

Is there a recursive solution? seems not

#### best time complexity

We at least need to walk through all letters, so it is at least O(N). And we actually only need to walk through once.

#### Test

```javascript
describe('Is Unique', () => {
  describe('s = example', () => {
    let s = 'example'
    expect(charactersIsUnique(s)).toEql(false)
  })
  describe('s = fast', () => {
    let s = 'fast'
    expect(charactersIsUnique(s)).toEql(true)
  })
})
```
