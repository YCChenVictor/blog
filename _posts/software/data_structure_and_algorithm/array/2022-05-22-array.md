## Introduction

In this post, we'll explore the basics of arrayLists, including their time complexity for common operations, and we'll also look at some common arrayLists algorithms.

An array is a fixed-length data structure. ArrayList is a variable-length data structure.

## Why?

ArrayLists are one of the most fundamental and widely used data structures, offering efficient storage and retrieval, simple implementation, versatility, efficiency, and being widely used in many fields of computer science.

## How?

### Basic Form

```javascript
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

* Data: A collection of elements of the **same data type**, arranged in a contiguous block of memory
* Time complexity:
  * Create an element: O(1) to O(N)
    * Inserting an element at the end of an arrayList has $$O(1)$$ but may be $$O(N)$$ if we need to resize the arrayList
    * Inserting an element at the beginning of an arrayList has $$O(N)$$ because we need to shift all the elements
  * Read an element: O(1) to O(N)
    * Given an index i, the read operation in an ArrayList retrieves the element at that index in constant time, regardless of the size of the ArrayList because the addresses of the items are stored **continuously** in memory, which means it can access other addresses by quick calculation of `memory_address = base_address + (index * element_size)` 
    * Linear search has $$O(N)$$ because it needs to search the value from beginning
  * Update an element: O(1)
    * Given an index i and a new value v, the update operation in an ArrayList replaces the element at index i with the new value v in constant time, regardless of the size of the ArrayList.
  * Delete an element: O(1) to O(N)
    * In the worst case, where n is the number of elements in the ArrayList because deleting an element requires shifting all subsequent elements one position to the left to fill the gap left by the deleted element. Deleting the last element in an ArrayList has a time complexity of O(1) on average because it can be done by simply updating the size of the ArrayList

Because the algorithm of string is just like arrayList, so I will put string algorithm in arrayList.

### URLify

* Question: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string.
* Example:
  * Input: "Mr John Smith ", 13
    * 13 is the length of the original string "Mr John Smith" excluding any trailing white spaces
  * Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
* brute force:
  ```javascript
  function URLify(string, length) {
    result = ''
    for (var i = 0; i < length; i ++) {
      if (i + 1 === length) {
        break
      } else if (string[i] === ' ') {
        result += '%20'
      } else {
        result += string[i]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

The time complexity = $$O(N + N)$$ = $$O(N)$$

* unnecessary work: On higher point of view, the loop to calculate `numberOfNotSpace` must be more unnecessary and the truth is we only need to break the loop if the loop meets space twice as follow:

```javascript
function URLify(string, length) {
  lastLetter = ''
  for (var i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    lastLetter = string[i]
    result = ''
    if (string[i] != ' ') {
      result += string[i]
    } else {
      result += '%20'
      if lasterLetter == '' {
        break
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then the time complexity = $$O(N)$$.

### Palindrome Permutation

(to be continued)

* Question: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­ drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
* brute force:

```javascript
function Palindrome(string) {
  diatonic = ''
  for (var i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    if (string[i] != ' ') {
      diatonic += string[i].lowercase
    }
  }
  chromatic = ''
  for (var i = array.length; i--;) {
    if (string[i] != ' ') {
      chromatic += string[i].lowercase
    }
  }

  if diatonic == chromatic {
    return true
  } else {
    return false
  }
}
```

The time complexity = $$O(N + N)$$ = $$O(N)$$

* unnecessary work: actually, if it is Palindrome, then the first half of the first loop is just like the last half of the second loop, so we may can optimize it with

```javascript
function Palindrome(string) {
  for (var i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    if (string[i] == ' ') {
      continue
    } elsif (string[i] == string[-i]) { // the correct way to call string[-i] is string.charAt(string.length - (i+1))
      continue
    } else {
      return false
    }
  }
}
```

Then the time complexity = $$O(N)$$. We can also try to break it at the point of middle, then the time complexity = $$O(N/2)$$

## TODO

* string
  * reversing a string
  * string is a palindrome
  * longest common prefix
* arrayList
  * finding the maximum subarray
  * binary search
  * sorting an arrayList
    * merge sort
    * quick sort

## What?

Real-world problem that uses an arrayList data structure and algorithm

* I want to create a search bar to search keyword on my website
* I need to use array to store the posts
  ```javascript
  const posts = [
    { title: "My first post", content: "This is my first post on the platform!", author: "Alice" },
    { title: "Cool photo", content: "Check out this cool photo I took on my vacation.", author: "Bob" },
    { title: "Important announcement", content: "We have an important announcement to make...", author: "Admin" }
  ];
  ```
* Implement the search function
  ```javascript
  function searchPosts(keyword) {
    const results = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < posts.length; i++) {
      const post = posts[i];
      
      if (post.title.includes(keyword) || post.content.includes(keyword)) {
        results.push(post);
      }
    }
    
    return results;
  }
  const results = searchPosts("vacation");
  console.log(results);
  ```
