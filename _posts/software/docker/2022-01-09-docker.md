## Introduction

Docker is a platform to develop, ship, and run applications in containers. Containers are a lightweight alternative to virtual machines that package an application and its dependencies together, allowing the application to run consistently across different environments. Docker provides tools for building and managing these containers, and it has become a popular choice for both development and production environments.

## Why?

Container isolates Apps from host so it can be run on consistently across different environments.

## How?

### install

```bash
brew install --cask docker
```

* check installation

```bash
docker info
```

### start docker

on mac, start docker with

```bash
open -a Docker
```

and shut down with

```bash
pkill -SIGHUP -f /Applications/Docker.app 'docker serve'
```

and run app with

```bash
docker run --name <xxx>
```

### applications

list container

```bash
docker ps
```

clear container

```bash
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)
```

terminate app

```bash
```

check app running on docker with

```bash
docker top <xxx>
```
