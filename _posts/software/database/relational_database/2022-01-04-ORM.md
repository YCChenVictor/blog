## Introduction

ORM (object relational mapping) lets programs query and manipulate data from database with object-oriented paradigm.

## Why?

* DRY, easier to maintain with the structure of model
* Miscellaneous task such as database connection can bed done automatically
* MVC structure enforced, making cleaner code structure
* No more SQL needed, making consistent coding style
* Abstract database system, so you can change it all the time
* OOP structure (hard to implement it to plain SQL)

## How?

* OOP & DRY (to be continued)
* reduce miscellaneous tasks (to be continued)
* MVC structure (to be continued)
* Abstract database: ORM uses Doctrine Database Abstraction Layer to serve as translator between database and programs
