## Introduction

Application programming interface is set of rules to interact with software.

## Why

With API, developers can access the functionality of one system within another system, without having to know the details of how the underlying system works.

## How

The concept of CRUD (create, read, update, delete) maps to POST, GET, PATCH/PUT, DELETE in [HTTP]({{site.baseurl}}/internet/2021/03/29/overview.html).

### RESTful API

For example,

```javascript
GET /tasks/new // (Create Show) Show the place to create task

POST /tasks // (Create) Add a new task to the list

GET /tasks // (Read list) Retrieve a list of all tasks

GET /tasks/{id} // (Read one) Retrieve a task with the specified ID

GET /records/:id/edit // (Update Show) Show the place to update task

PUT /tasks/{id} // (Update a task) Update a task with the specified ID

PATCH /tasks/{id} // (Update a task partially) Update a task with the specified ID

DELETE /tasks/{id} // (Destroy one) Delete a task with the specified ID
```

The URL structure follows the RESTful pattern of using a noun (in this case, "tasks") to represent a resource and the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to specify the action to be taken on that resource.

refer to [concept of REST]({{site.baseurl}}/api/2023/01/22/restful.html)

### node

[node api]({{site.baseurl}}/node/2022/01/26/api.html)

### rails

* POST /events -> /events/create -> events#create
* GET /events/1 -> /events/show/1 -> events#show
* PATCH /events/1 -> /events/update/1 -> events#update
* DELETE /events/1 -> /events/destroy/1 -> events#destroy

HTML now can only use GET and POST; as a result, rails adds params, method=PATCH and method=DELETE in POST for PATCH and DELETE.

refer to [rails API]({{site.baseurl}}/rails/2022/02/05/routes.html)

### frontend vs backend

If you need to make the API requests private, then put it on backend. Always create frontend first because UI/UX is more important.

## What

### curl

Just place the basic commands here because I usually use postman.

```bash
# create
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"name\": \"John Doe\"}" localhost:8080/api/students

# read

# update

# delete
```

### Postman

#### GET

#### POST

#### JWT

I think we can have more JWT designs here.

### Jenkins API
