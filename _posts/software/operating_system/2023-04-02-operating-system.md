## Introduction

* A software program that manages the hardware and software resources of a computer system
  * hardware resources: CPU, memory, and I/O devices
  * software resources: files, databases, and network connections
* Interface between computer applications and the computer hardware
* Responsible for managing the computer's memory, processing power, storage, input/output devices, and other resources.
* Types
  * desktop operating systems
    * Microsoft Windows
    * macOS
    * Linux
  * server operating systems
  * mobile operating systems
    * Android
    * iOS
  * embedded operating systems

## Why?

* To understand how computers work at a low level for computer engineering, software development, and information technology
* To develop efficient and effective software applications that work well with the underlying operating system
* To managing computer systems, including servers, networks, and other infrastructure 
* To Enhance security that protect computer systems from external threats, including viruses and hackers

### Distribute Systems

A distributed system refers to a network of interconnected computers that work together to solve a common problem or perform a coordinated task. It involves the distribution of resources, data, and processing across multiple machines, enabling collaboration and scalability beyond the capabilities of a single system. For more information, please refer to [distributed systems]()

### Real-time operating systems
