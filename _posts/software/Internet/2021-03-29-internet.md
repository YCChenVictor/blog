## Introduction

The internet is a system to connect all computers globally, mainly using internet protocol suite to communicate with all the objects in the network.

## Why

TBC

## How

### internet protocol suite

* **conceptual model** used in network model
* foundation
  * Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
  * Internet Protocol (IP)

A simple structure of TCP/IP is as follow:

* Link layer: a computer (sender) want to send data to another computer (receiver), the sender will send electromagnetic signals. These signals walk through wired or wireless connections from sender to receiver.
* Network layer (IP): Once the number of computers grow, we need to specify the address to identify which one is receiver. The address for identification is IP address. We called all the computer in this network **nodes**.

Now the network looks like

* Transport layer (TCP): In the network plot above, if a sender wants to send signal to another computer, there are many path for signal to walk.
* (interlude) **Packet Switching**: The concept of packet switching is that it **breaks down the data** into small pieces and transfer these pieces with any possible routes to the destination and reassemble these pieces to show the complete data to the users at the destination.

I am going to explain the way to decompose the data and the way to transfer it with following example:

At the moment when the data is going to be sent, the available routes may be as follow:
<img src="/assets/img/1__kF7aAIKeqLdK7SH9b0vavw.png" alt="" width=500>

1. If there is arrows between nodes, then there is connection between the two computers and we call it the **path**.
2. The number near the arrow is the cost to send a unit of data from sender to receiver.

Based on these two concepts, we can define algorithms such as walk through minimum path and walk through minimum cost.

**TCP is used to make sure the packets are truly transported:**

1. sender want to send data to receiver
2. the data being decomposed into packets
3. algorithm pops up to determine how packets being sent
4. the packets walk through the routes in networks and being reassembled at destination
5. if the receiver did not receive the data, then tell sender to send again.

### Application Layer

After the data arrives at destination, the receiver use Hypertext Transfer Protocol, abbreviated to [HTTP]({{site.baseurl}}/internet/2021/04/09/http.html), to translate the data from sender and then the page will show up on the receiver’s browsers.

### Networking Metrics

* Bandwidth
  * Purpose:
  * Concept: It measures the maximum data transfer rate of a network connection, usually expressed in bits per second (bps). It determines the capacity of a network to transmit data.
  * Example:
* Latency: Latency refers to the time it takes for a packet of data to travel from the source to the destination. It is usually measured in milliseconds (ms) and represents the delay or responsiveness of the network.
* Packet Loss: Packet loss indicates the percentage of packets that are transmitted but fail to reach their destination. It can be caused by network congestion, faulty equipment, or other issues. Lower packet loss is desirable for reliable network communication.
* Jitter: Jitter measures the variation in latency over time. It is the difference in delay between packets in a network flow. High jitter can lead to inconsistent or poor-quality audio and video streams in real-time applications.
* Throughput: Throughput refers to the amount of data that can be transmitted over a network in a given time period. It is usually measured in bits per second (bps) and represents the actual data transfer rate.
* Round-trip time (RTT): RTT measures the time it takes for a packet to travel from the source to the destination and back again. It is commonly used in network diagnostics and troubleshooting.
* Network Availability: Network availability represents the percentage of time a network is operational and accessible to users. It is an important metric for measuring network reliability and downtime.
* Network Utilization: Network utilization measures the percentage of available network resources being utilized at a given time. It indicates how efficiently the network is being utilized and helps identify potential bottlenecks.
* Error Rate: Error rate measures the frequency of errors or corrupted data packets occurring in a network. A high error rate can indicate network issues or problems with the transmission medium.
* Quality of Service (QoS): QoS refers to the ability of a network to prioritize certain types of traffic over others, ensuring that critical applications receive the necessary resources and bandwidth for optimal performance.
