## Introduction

TBC

## Why?

Quality assurance aims to ensure a positive and satisfactory user experience by implementing measures to enhance the overall quality of a product or service.

## How?

All the purpose are the same as in the why section. The priorities is ordered as follow:

* Functional Testing
  * Concept: Test whether a system or software application functions correctly and delivers the expected results.
  * Example
    * Pen: Verify that the pen writes smoothly and consistently. Test different writing angles (horizontal, vertical) to ensure ink flow remains consistent. Check that the pen produces clear and legible lines.
    * E-commerce: Validate that users can successfully search for products, view product details, add items to the cart, proceed to checkout, and complete the purchase without encountering any functional issues or errors.
* Unit Testing
  * Concept: Testing individual units or components of the software in isolation to ensure they function correctly.
  * Example
    * Pen: TBC (2023-06-20)
    * Software: Testing the "calculateTotalPrice" function to ensure that it correctly calculates the total price of items in the shopping cart.
* Feature Testing
  * Concept: Feature testing focuses on thoroughly testing individual features or functionalities of a software application to ensure they meet the specified requirements and provide the desired functionality to users.
  * Example: In an e-commerce application, an example of feature testing could be testing the "Add to Cart" functionality to ensure that products are successfully added to the cart, the cart total is calculated accurately, and the inventory is updated accordingly.
* Integration Testing
  * Concept: Verifying the interaction and communication between different components or modules to ensure they work together as intended.
  * Example: Testing the integration between the payment gateway and the e-commerce website to ensure that the payment process is smooth and transactions are processed accurately.
* System Testing
  * Concept: Testing the entire system as a whole to ensure it meets the specified requirements and functions correctly in its intended environment.
  * Example: Testing the end-to-end functionality of the e-commerce website, including user registration, product browsing, adding items to the cart, and completing the checkout process.
* Acceptance Testing
  * Concept: Testing the software's compliance with user requirements and validating that it meets the acceptance criteria defined by stakeholders.
  * Example: Conducting user acceptance testing on the e-commerce website to ensure that it meets the specified requirements, such as validating user registration, testing different types of product searches, and making test purchases.
* Regression Testing
  * Concept: Repeating previously executed tests to ensure that previously working functionality still works after changes or updates have been made to the software.
  * Example: After introducing a new feature on the e-commerce website, rerunning tests to ensure that existing functionality, such as product browsing, cart management, and order placement, still works as expected.
* Performance Testing
  * Concept: Evaluating the software's performance under specific conditions, such as load testing, stress testing, or endurance testing, to ensure it meets performance requirements.
  * Example: Simulating a high number of concurrent users on the e-commerce website to evaluate its response time, page load speed, and server performance under heavy traffic conditions.
* Security Testing
  * Concept: Identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the software's security measures to ensure it is adequately protected against potential threats.
  * Example: Conducting security testing on the e-commerce website to identify vulnerabilities, such as testing for SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and ensuring secure transmission of sensitive information like payment details.
* Usability Testing
  * Concept: Assessing the software's user-friendliness and ease of use, including aspects such as navigation, intuitiveness, and overall user experience.
  * Example: Observing users as they interact with the e-commerce website to assess the intuitiveness of the user interface, ease of navigation, and overall user experience in finding and purchasing products.
* Compatibility Testing
  * Concept: Testing the software's compatibility with different platforms, operating systems, browsers, devices, or external dependencies to ensure it functions correctly in various environments.
  * Example: Testing the e-commerce website on different web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux), and devices (desktop, mobile, tablet) to ensure consistent functionality and display.
* Exploratory Testing
  * Concept: Informal testing where testers actively explore the software to discover defects, usability issues, or areas of concern that may not be covered by scripted tests.
  * Example: Manually exploring the e-commerce website to discover and report any unexpected behavior, usability issues, or defects that were not covered in scripted test cases, such as testing different payment methods or coupon code functionality.
* Localization and Internationalization Testing
  * Concept: Testing the software's compatibility with different languages, cultures, and regional settings to ensure it can be used globally.
  * Example: Testing the e-commerce website with different languages, currencies, and regional settings to ensure that the user interface, product information, and pricing are appropriately localized for different target markets.
* Accessibility Testing
  * Concept: Evaluating the software's accessibility features to ensure it can be used by individuals with disabilities and meets relevant accessibility guidelines and standards.
  * Example: Testing the e-commerce website using assistive technologies like screen readers to ensure it is accessible to individuals with disabilities, including proper labeling of elements, keyboard navigation, and alternative text for images.

## What?

## Other

Integrate following tests to above

Durability Testing:

Test the pen's resistance to pressure by applying force on the pen tip while writing.
Check if the pen withstands accidental drops or impacts without breaking.
Verify that the pen's ink does not smudge or fade easily.

Usability Testing:

Assess the pen's ergonomics, such as grip comfort and weight distribution.
Evaluate the ease of use for different hand sizes.
Test the pen's retractable mechanism (if applicable) for smooth and reliable operation.

Compatibility Testing:

Test the pen's compatibility with different paper types, including regular, glossy, and textured surfaces.
Verify that the pen's ink is compatible with standard refills or cartridges (if applicable).

Integration Testing:

If the pen has additional features (e.g., electronic components, digital capabilities), test the integration and functionality of those features.

Unit Testing:

Test individual components of the pen, such as the ink cartridge or retractable mechanism, to ensure their proper functioning.

System Testing:

Test the pen in its intended system or environment, ensuring it functions correctly with other components such as pen holders or ink refilling mechanisms.
Acceptance Testing:

Conduct user acceptance testing with a sample group to ensure the pen meets their requirements and expectations.
Regression Testing:

After making changes or updates to the pen, rerun previously executed tests to ensure existing functionality still works as expected.
Performance Testing:

Evaluate the pen's performance under different conditions, such as writing speed, ink drying time, or continuous usage, to ensure it meets performance requirements.
Usability Testing:

Assess the pen's overall user-friendliness, ease of use, and user experience, considering factors such as pen grip, ink flow control, and overall comfort.
Exploratory Testing:

Manually explore the pen's functionalities to discover any unexpected defects, usability issues, or areas of concern that may not be covered by scripted tests.
Localization and Internationalization Testing:

If the pen is intended for a global market, test its compatibility with different languages, cultures, and regional settings to ensure it can be used internationally.
Accessibility Testing:

Evaluate the pen's accessibility features to ensure it can be used by individuals with disabilities, such as considering tactile feedback, ease of gripping, or alternative writing options.
