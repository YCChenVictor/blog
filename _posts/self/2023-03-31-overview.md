It's important to strive for balance in life and work towards improving all aspects of your life. While your core values provide a framework for decision-making and can guide you in pursuing a fulfilling life, it's also important to address any areas where you may be lacking or experiencing challenges. For example, if you're not taking care of your health or neglecting important relationships, it may be worth prioritizing those areas of your life in order to create a more balanced and fulfilling life overall.

In short, you can live for your core values while also working to improve other aspects of your life that may be important to your overall well-being.
