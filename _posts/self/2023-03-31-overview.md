It's important to strive for balance in life and work towards improving all aspects of your life. While your core values provide a framework for decision-making and can guide you in pursuing a fulfilling life, it's also important to address any areas where you may be lacking or experiencing challenges. For example, if you're not taking care of your health or neglecting important relationships, it may be worth prioritizing those areas of your life in order to create a more balanced and fulfilling life overall.

## what to do

Based on my [core value]({{site.baseurl}}/self/2023/03/31/core-value.html), my goal now is to make an app to solve a problem.

* < 1 year: get a job in Canada
* 1 year ~ 5 year: launch beta first of my APP and get tractions
* > 5 year: Get funds

-> Just focus on finishing cracking the coding interview now -> try to finish full map of [software] -> just be realistic and honest in behavior questions and I can prepare them when I get interview
