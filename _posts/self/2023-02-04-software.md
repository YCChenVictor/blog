## Introduction

Software is a set of instructions and data that tell a computer what to do
* Application software: This includes software applications designed for specific purposes, such as word processors, spreadsheets, video editors, and games.
* System software: This includes software that manages and controls the hardware and other components of a computer system, such as operating systems, device drivers, and utility programs.
* Embedded software: This includes software that is integrated into devices and systems such as smartphones, automobiles, and medical equipment.
* Web-based software: This includes software that is accessed through web browsers or other web-enabled devices, such as web applications, cloud-based software, and e-commerce platforms.
  * Web 3.0, also known as the "decentralized web" or "semantic web", is an evolving concept that refers to a set of new technologies and applications that aim to build a more decentralized, secure, and user-centric web.
  * Some of the key features of Web 3.0 include decentralized data storage, decentralized identity, decentralized finance (DeFi), and decentralized applications (dApps) that run on blockchain-based platforms. Web 3.0 also aims to address some of the challenges and limitations of Web 2.0, such as issues related to data privacy, security, and ownership.
* Artificial intelligence and machine learning software: This includes software that uses algorithms and data to simulate human intelligence and behavior, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics.
* Database software: This includes software that is used to store, manage, and manipulate large amounts of data, such as relational database management systems (RDBMS) and NoSQL databases.
* Development tools: This includes software that is used to create, test, and debug other software, such as integrated development environments (IDEs), code editors, and compilers.
* Security software: This includes software that is designed to protect computer systems and data from unauthorized access and other security threats, such as antivirus software, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.
