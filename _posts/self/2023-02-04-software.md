## Introduction

Software refers to a set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do. It encompasses all the applications, programs, and data that run on digital devices, enabling them to perform various tasks and functions.

## Why?

For me as web developer
* Automate repetitive tasks
* Improved job performance
* Enhanced creativity of future

## How?

Software is a set of instructions and data that tell a computer what to do

### System software

This type of software is designed to manage and control the hardware and software resources of a computer system. Examples include operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as device drivers and utility programs like antivirus software and disk management tools. For more information, please refer to [operating systems]({{site.baseurl}}/os/2023/04/02/overview.html).

### Application software

This type of software is designed for specific tasks or applications, such as word processing, spreadsheet creation, email management, and graphic design. Examples include Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Suite, and Google Chrome.
  * Web application
    * Plan and Design: [Plan and design]() the user interface and functionality of your web application. Decide on the features you want to include and how users will interact with the application.
    * Develop: Write the code for your web application, including the frontend (user interface) and the backend (server-side logic). This may involve using frameworks and tools such as [React]({{site.baseurl}}/react/2021/06/13/react.html), [Vue.js](), Angular, [Node.js]({{site.baseurl}}/node/2022/12/30/node.html), or [Ruby on Rails]({{site.baseurl}}/rails/2023/01/01/rails.html), depending on your programming language of choice.
    * Deploy and Maintain: [Deploy] your web application to a web server and maintain it by regularly updating it with bug fixes and [security]({{site.baseurl}}/web-security/2022/08/30/web-security.html) patches. This may also involve [scaling]() the application to handle increased traffic or integrating it with other systems or APIs.
  * Non-web application

### Embedded software

This type of software is designed to control and manage hardware devices and systems, and is often built into the devices themselves. Examples include the software that controls a car's engine, a digital camera's image processing, or a smart thermostat's temperature control.
