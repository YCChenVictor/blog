## Introduction

Aesthetics is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of beauty and taste, as well as the creation and appreciation of art. It is a complex and multifaceted field that encompasses a wide range of ideas and perspectives, including cultural, historical, and philosophical approaches.

(Me) To clarify, this article is to define the aesthetics. As a result, it must be confined to human-beings' objective and subjective aspects, meaning it is not any higher dimensional solution but a temporary escape from the sufferings.

## Why?

* Enhanced appreciation of art: To develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of different forms of art, whether it be music, literature, painting, sculpture, or other forms of creative expression.
* Critical thinking skills: To develop a more nuanced understanding of different perspectives and worldviews, as well as sharpen your ability to articulate your own ideas and opinions.
* Personal growth and self-expression: Explore own sense of creativity and self-expression.
* Cultural and historical understanding: By studying aesthetics, you can gain a deeper understanding of different cultures and historical contexts, and how they have influenced the art and ideas of different eras.

## How?

### concepts

* Beauty and the sublime
  * Beauty: The quality of an object or experience that evokes pleasure, admiration, or satisfaction
  * Sublime, The experience of something that is awe-inspiring, overwhelming, or transcendent
* Form and content
  * Form: The physical characteristics of an object or the way it is presented (e.g., color, texture, composition)
  * Content: The meaning or message conveyed by the artwork
* Aesthetic experience: The subjective response one has to an object, whether it is a work of art or a natural landscape.
  * What makes certain experiences aesthetically valuable or meaningful
  * How different factors such as context, culture, and personal preferences can shape our aesthetic responses.
* Criticism and evaluation
  * Evaluation: Evaluating artworks based on criteria such as originality, creativity, expressiveness, and technical skill
  * Criticism: Engage in critical debates about the value and meaning of different artistic movements and styles.

### Immanuel Kant

* Most important figures in modern philosophy
* German philosopher of the 18th century
* His philosophy is often characterized as a synthesis of rationalism and empiricism
* He believed that all human knowledge is based on experience, but argued that our experience is shaped by our mental faculties, which are themselves governed by certain universal and necessary principles
* "Critique of Pure Reason" (1781)
  * There are certain categories of thought, such as time, space, and causality, that are necessary for us to make sense of our experience of the world
  * He distinguished between the "phenomenal" world of appearances, which is accessible to our senses, and the "noumenal" world of things-in-themselves, which is beyond our knowledge.
    * "Noumenal" is a term used by Kant to refer to the things-in-themselves, or the objects of our experience that are beyond the realm of appearances. According to Kant, the noumenal world is the ultimate reality that exists independently of our perception of it.
    * Kant believed that our experience of the world is shaped by our mental faculties, which impose certain necessary and universal categories on our perceptions. These categories, such as time, space, and causality, enable us to make sense of our experience of the world, but they also limit what we can know about the world. Because the noumenal world lies beyond the limits of our understanding, it is inaccessible to us.
* "Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals" (1785)
  * Kant argued that moral principles are not based on consequences or the particular circumstances of a situation, but are rather grounded in reason itself. He believed that there are certain universal and necessary moral principles, such as the principle of respect for persons, that apply to all rational beings.
* "Critique of Judgment" (1790)
  * Aesthetic judgments are based on the subjective experience of pleasure or displeasure in response to an object.
  * Also, He argued that there are certain objective criteria that make an object beautiful, such as qualities like harmony, proportion, and unity. Kant believed that aesthetic judgments are universal in the sense.
  * The experience of beauty is not limited to a select few individuals. Rather, anyone who has the capacity to experience pleasure can make an aesthetic judgment about an object, whether they are an expert in the field of art or not.
  * Disinterestedness: In making an aesthetic judgment, we are not concerned with whether the object will be useful to us or serve a particular purpose. Rather, we are interested in the object purely for its own sake, and we take pleasure in contemplating its beauty.
  * He also recognized that many works of art have some kind of purpose, such as religious or political art, and that this purpose does not necessarily detract from their status as art. A solution can still be considered art if it is created with the intention of providing an aesthetic experience and is able to elicit a disinterested pleasure in the viewer.
    * The idea that not just the solution, but also the process, is aesthetic.
      * In architecture, the design process itself can be seen as an aesthetic experience, as architects make creative choices about form, function, and materials in order to create beautiful and functional buildings.
      * In product design, the process of creating a product can be seen as an aesthetic experience, as designers make choices about the form, color, and texture of the product in order to create a pleasing and functional design.
      * In creative arts, such as painting or sculpture, the creative process itself can be seen as an aesthetic experience, as artists make choices about composition, color, and form in order to create works that are beautiful and meaningful.
* (Me) So whether there is a correct way during the process? => Let's proceed to Arthur Schopenhauer

### Arthur Schopenhauer

* 19th century German philosopher
* pessimistic views on human existence and the importance of individual experience and subjectivity.
* "The World as Will and Representation," (1818)
  * Will is the underlying, unconscious force that drives all life
  * Representation is the world as it appears to us through our senses
  * Will is the source of all human suffering and desire, and the only way to escape this suffering is to deny the will through the practice of asceticism or the contemplation of aesthetic experience. He argues that art and beauty offer a temporary escape from the suffering of the will, allowing us to experience a moment of transcendence and detachment from the world
* (Me) Ok, so it seems aesthetics helps people escape suffering and the process of creating object should try our best to think how to transport the viewer beyond the limitations of individual existence and connect them with a deeper, universal reality. In this way, the creator's choices in form, color, and texture are aimed at evoking a sense of transcendence and beauty in others, and helping them to escape from the suffering of the will. So which one can help the most? => According to WHO, the biggest suffering now is Mental health issues such as Depression, anxiety, stress => What's the causes of these sufferings? => Please refer to next section

### Causes of mental illness

On the point of

* Existentialist philosophers
  * Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Heidegger
  * Mental health issues can be caused by a sense of meaninglessness or purposelessness in life
  * Human beings are fundamentally free, but that this freedom can be overwhelming and lead to feelings of anxiety and despair
  * Depression and other mental health issues can arise when individuals feel cut off from their own sense of purpose and creativity
  * Solution: Take responsibility for own choices and actions, embrace own freedom, create their own meaning in life, rather than relying on external sources of meaning or authority
* Psychoanalytic theorists
  * Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan
  * Mental health issues can be caused by unconscious conflicts and repressed emotions. According to this view, individuals may be struggling with unresolved traumas or unresolved feelings, which can lead to symptoms such as anxiety or depression
  * Solution: Psychoanalysis, a form of talk therapy that aims to explore and resolve unconscious conflicts and unresolved psychological issues that contribute to mental health issues.
* Social and critical theorists
  * Michel Foucault
  * Mental illness is not simply an individual problem, but is also shaped by broader social and political forces. According to Foucault, mental illness is often the result of a complex interplay between power, knowledge, and social norms
  * Solution: Address and challenge broader social structures, rather than solely focusing on individual-level interventions. This can involve advocating for policy changes that address social inequality, challenging cultural norms and values that contribute to mental health issues, and creating more supportive and inclusive communities.
* (Me) Is there a standard to evaluate these three factors? => biopsychosocial model (next section)

### Biopsychosocial Model

* Understanding the biological basis of aesthetics: By examining the neurological processes involved in aesthetic experiences, researchers can gain insights into how our brains respond to different forms of art and beauty. For example, studies have shown that certain areas of the brain, such as the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala, are involved in our emotional responses to art.
* Examining the psychological factors that influence aesthetic preferences: By studying the role of personality traits, emotional states, and cognitive processes in aesthetic judgments, researchers can gain a better understanding of why people have different aesthetic preferences. For example, studies have shown that people who score high in the personality trait of openness to experience tend to have more varied and eclectic aesthetic tastes.
* Considering the social and cultural factors that shape aesthetic preferences: By examining the role of cultural background, social norms, and peer influences in shaping aesthetic preferences, researchers can gain insights into how these factors contribute to the diversity of aesthetic experiences across different societies and cultures.
* (Me) Now I know there are certain reasons these factors connects to aesthetics. But right before human-beings, the universe is there. How to define the aesthetics of universe? => Objective aspects, all the universal rules, no subjective aspects at all => Now the design fitting aesthetics well with two meanings:
  * Reduce the chaos people produced themselves => Why people create own chaos?
    * Existentialism: Creating one's own chaos can be seen as a way of asserting one's freedom and individuality. Existentialists believe that humans are fundamentally free, and that we must create our own meaning in life. For some, creating chaos can be a way of asserting their freedom and creating a sense of meaning or purpose in their lives.
    * Stoicism: Creating chaos could be seen as a failure to cultivate inner calm and rationality. Stoics believe that we should focus on what we can control, and that our emotions should not be ruled by external events. Creating chaos could be seen as a failure to maintain this inner calm, and a failure to focus on what is truly important.
    * Buddhism: Creating chaos could be seen as a manifestation of the ego, which seeks to create a sense of self-importance and identity. Buddhism teaches that suffering is caused by attachment to the ego and the external world, and that true happiness comes from letting go of these attachments. Creating chaos could be seen as a manifestation of attachment to the ego and the external world, rather than a focus on inner peace and well-being.
  * Follow the universal rules as many as possible => Why people cannot follow universal rules?
    * Ethics: People may prioritize their own interests over the interests of others, or that they may have conflicting moral obligations.
    * Social and Political Philosophy: People may not follow rules if they do not believe that they have agreed to them.
    * Epistemology: Due to limitations in their knowledge or understanding.
    * Existentialism: Because of their individualistic and subjective nature.
  * (Me) Now I know the practical solutions: Incentivizing following universal rules and Discouraging creating chaos. But both of these solutions can trigger side effects according to other philosophies. As a result, the only way is to combine both => Promoting positive social norms

### Promoting Positive Social Norms

My definition of positive social norms is people should try their best to extend human society because if something cause problems, something will be eliminate eventually, meaning I should try to increase humanity.

#### Design Principle

* breadth (region)
  * Adaptability: Designs should be adaptable to changing environmental conditions.
  * Resilience: Designs should be resilient to environmental hazards such as floods, storms, and earthquakes. This might involve designing structures that can withstand high winds or flooding, or developing systems that can continue to operate in the event of power outages or other disruptions.
  * Resource efficiency: Designs should be resource-efficient and minimize waste. This might include designing structures that use renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power, or developing systems that conserve water and other resources.
  * Mobility: Designs should promote mobility and enable people to move between regions or environments. This might include developing new transportation systems or designing structures that can be easily relocated.
  * Connectivity: Designs should promote connectivity and enable people to communicate and collaborate across regions or environments. This might include developing new communication technologies or designing structures that facilitate social interaction and community building.
* depth (time)
  * Sustainable and regenerative design: This involves designing systems and structures that minimize waste, reduce energy consumption, and use renewable resources wherever possible. It also involves designing for biodiversity, ecosystem services, and regenerative practices.
  * Resilient infrastructure: This involves designing infrastructure that is resilient to natural disasters and other disruptions, and that can adapt to changing conditions and challenges over time. It also involves designing for redundancies, flexibility, and redundancy.
  * Social and economic equity: This involves designing social and economic systems that are equitable and inclusive, and that promote access to basic needs such as food, shelter, education, and healthcare. It also involves designing for diversity, inclusion, and accessibility.
  * Technological innovation: This involves designing and developing new technologies that can address current and future challenges facing human society, such as climate change, resource depletion, and environmental degradation.
  * Participatory design: This involves involving diverse stakeholders and communities in the design process, and ensuring that their needs and perspectives are considered and incorporated into the design of systems and structures.

## What?

### Increase Personal Aesthetics

* Observe and appreciate art
  * Visit museums, galleries, and exhibitions
  * Observe and appreciate different types of art
  * Understand different styles and techniques to broaden artistic perspective
* Practice art
  * Practicing art
    * Painting
    * Drawing
    * Sculpting
    * [Music]
* Experiment with design: Experiment with design principles, such as color, form, and composition, in your daily life. This can help you develop a better eye for aesthetics and recognize good design.
* Explore nature: Nature is a great source of inspiration for aesthetics. Take the time to explore natural landscapes, observe the details, and appreciate the beauty of the natural world.
* Engage with different cultures: Different cultures have different aesthetic values and norms. Engaging with different cultures and their art can broaden your understanding of aesthetics and help you appreciate the diversity of the world.

### Increase Personal Humanity

Based on the idea of humanity

* Practice empathy and kindness: One of the simplest ways to increase humanity is to be kind to others and treat them with empathy and compassion. This can involve things like listening actively, offering a helping hand, and being supportive.
* Volunteer and donate: Volunteering your time or donating to a worthy cause can have a big impact on your community and beyond. You can volunteer at a local shelter, soup kitchen, or other organization that helps those in need. You can also donate to charities that support causes you care about.
* Educate yourself: Educating yourself on the issues facing the world today is an important step in increasing humanity. Read books, watch documentaries, and seek out diverse perspectives to gain a better understanding of the world around you.
* Speak out against injustice: When you see injustice happening, speak out against it. This can involve writing letters to your elected officials, joining protests, and standing up for those who are marginalized.
* Foster positive relationships
  * Building positive relationships with the people
  * Listening actively, being supportive, and showing appreciation for the people in your life
  * Some experts recommend having at least three to five close relationships that are characterized by mutual support, trust, and intimacy
    * I can use the five close relationships to evaluate myself
  * At least, family, friends, coworkers

### Website

Based on the idea of promoting positive social norms

* Adaptability
  * Mobile-first approach: Designing for mobile devices first ensures that the website's core features and content are accessible to users on smaller screens. This approach also makes it easier to scale up the design for larger screens. 
  * Responsive design: Adjust its layout and content based on the screen size of the device it is being viewed on.
  * Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs): SVGs are vector-based graphics that can be scaled up or down without losing their quality. They are a great option for logos, icons, and other design elements that need to be displayed at different sizes on different devices.
  * Flexible Grids: Using flexible grids, such as CSS Grid or Flexbox, can help create a layout that adapts to different screen sizes. This allows the website to adjust the size and position of elements on the page automatically.
  * Progressive enhancement: This approach involves designing a website that works on all devices and browsers, regardless of their capabilities. It starts with a basic version of the website that works on older devices and then adds more advanced features for newer devices.
* Resilience
  * Minimize downtime: Use a reliable web hosting provider, ensure that your website is regularly backed up, and have a plan in place for quickly restoring the website in the event of a disruption or outage.
  * Design for redundancy: Create redundant systems or backup servers that can take over if the main server fails. This ensures that the website can remain operational even if there is a hardware failure or other unexpected outage.
  * Optimize performance: Optimize the website's performance by minimizing page load times, using caching, and compressing images and other media. This will help the website to continue functioning smoothly even during periods of high traffic or other demand.
  * Use robust coding practices: Use secure coding practices, keep software and plugins up to date, and use a Content Management System (CMS) that is known for its security and reliability.
  * Test regularly: Test the website regularly to ensure that it is functioning as expected and to identify and address any issues before they become major problems.
* Resource efficiency
