## Introduction

Aesthetics is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of beauty and taste, as well as the creation and appreciation of art. It is a complex and multifaceted field that encompasses a wide range of ideas and perspectives, including cultural, historical, and philosophical approaches.

(Me) To clarify, this article is to define the aesthetics. As a result, it must be confined to human-beings' objective and subjective aspects, meaning it is not any higher dimensional solution but a temporary escape from the sufferings.

## Why?

Studying aesthetics can enhance appreciation and understanding of diverse forms of art, sharpen critical thinking skills, foster personal growth and self-expression, and provide insight into different cultures and historical contexts.

## How?

### Basic Steps

The basic steps for aesthetics is as follow

* Understand beauty and sublime
  * Beauty: The quality of an object or experience that evokes pleasure, admiration, or satisfaction
  * Sublime, The experience of something that is awe-inspiring, overwhelming, or transcendent
* Build form and content
  * Form: The physical characteristics of an object or the way it is presented (e.g., color, texture, composition)
  * Content: The meaning or message conveyed by the artwork
* Immerse aesthetic experience: The subjective response one has to an object, whether it is a work of art or a natural landscape.
  * What makes certain experiences aesthetically valuable or meaningful
  * How different factors such as context, culture, and personal preferences can shape our aesthetic responses.
* Do criticism and evaluation
  * Evaluation: Evaluating artworks based on criteria such as originality, creativity, expressiveness, and technical skill
  * Criticism: Engage in critical debates about the value and meaning of different artistic movements and styles.

### Philosophy Approach

Aesthetics in philosophy is concerned with the study of beauty, art, and taste, and aims to develop a philosophical understanding of these concepts. Philosophers of aesthetics explore questions such as what makes something beautiful, how we should evaluate works of art, and whether aesthetic experiences have inherent value.

## What?

Based on last section, I concluded we should try to **increase humanity** to boost aesthetics.

### Increase Personal Aesthetics

Explore different types of art by visiting museums and exhibitions, and practice various forms of art like sketching and music to develop your skills and perspective. Experiment with design principles and broaden your aesthetic understanding by engaging with nature and diverse cultures. For more information, please refer to [personal aesthetics]({{site.baseurl}}/aesthetics/2023/04/29/personal-aesthetics.html)

### Increase Personal Humanity

The practice of humanity can lead to greater understanding and acceptance of diverse perspectives and experiences, and ultimately, to a more harmonious and peaceful global community. By prioritizing humanity in our interactions and decisions, we can create a better world for ourselves and future generations.

### Design

* User-centered design: User-centered design principles prioritize the needs, goals, and preferences of end-users, resulting in more useful, usable, and enjoyable products and services, as well as increased accessibility, inclusivity, and satisfaction for users, particularly those with disabilities or special needs.
* Sustainable design: Incorporating sustainable design principles into the design process can reduce the negative impact of products and services on the environment, improve the long-term viability of natural resources, minimize waste and pollution, and maximize efficiency, durability, and recyclability.
* Ethical design: Through ethical design principles, designers can ensure that their products and services promote social justice, fairness, and transparency by considering the ethical implications of design decisions, avoiding harm, exploitation, and discrimination, and promoting trust, respect, and accountability.
* Emotional design: Designers can enhance people's well-being, happiness, and satisfaction by creating products and services that evoke positive emotions and experiences, using emotional design principles that improve aesthetic appeal, usability, and memorability, while fostering positive brand identity and loyalty.
* Universal design: Designers can promote social inclusion, diversity, and equity by designing accessible and usable products and environments for all people, regardless of their age, gender, culture, or abilities, using universal design principles that minimize physical and social barriers, while maximizing flexibility, adaptability, and usability for all users.

## Introduction

Aesthetic experiences include listening to music in any place, stickers on my laptop, feelings when looking at sunset, savoring the first bite of meal, emotionally investing in the characters in movie or noval.

Aesthetic was invented by Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten. He defined what a good art is by studying good and bad taste, linking good taste with beauty.

Art imitates the objects and events of ordinary life. - Plato

The aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance. - Aristotle

## Why?

Given we have various art (we do not define why we need art here) -> Aesthetic defines good taste of art -> It should be accepted by people but not tawdry -> just like one to many -> ... -> the combination of one person's sensories and universe

## How?

1. Truely feel the gift from universe
2. express the feelings with your own prespective
3. mingle them

### gift from universe

You need to touch it. The ways would be traveling to know through nature, reading to know through other people's eye, religious beliefs to explore inner world.

### the feelings

The feelings should be true part of yourself. The feelings towards nature. The true feelings. Express the true desire. Try to know the deepest desire of your own. What is my central idea? What am I going to mingle with the gift from universe?

### mingle them

Document them, through writing, drawing, music, cooking, ...etc

## What?
