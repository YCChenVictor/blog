## Introduction

## Why?

I just want to learn it.

## How?

### Physiology

Physiology is the study of how living organisms function at the cellular, tissue, organ, and system level. It encompasses the study of both the normal and abnormal functioning of living organisms and how they interact with their environment.

* Homeostasis: Homeostasis is the maintenance of a stable internal environment despite external changes, which is controlled by feedback mechanisms in the body.
  * Maintaining a stable internal environment: Homeostasis helps maintain a relatively constant internal environment, despite changes in the external environment, by regulating various physiological variables such as body temperature, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels.
    * Body temperature: The body regulates body temperature through several mechanisms, including sweating, shivering, and changes in blood flow. These mechanisms help to either dissipate or retain heat to maintain a stable body temperature.
      * Sweating: Sweat glands produce sweat composed of water and electrolytes that evaporate on the skin surface, taking heat away from the body and cooling the skin. The hypothalamus senses temperature changes and signals the sweat glands via the sympathetic nervous system to produce sweat, which is known as thermoregulatory sweating and regulates body temperature by dissipating heat.
      * Shivering: The hypothalamus sends signals to muscles to generate heat through rapid muscle contractions and activates the sympathetic nervous system to release adrenaline, which increases metabolic rate and stimulates muscle activity, helping to raise body temperature and maintain a stable internal environment. This process requires the breakdown of glucose and the release of energy in the form of heat.
      * Changes in blood flow: Blood vessels in the skin constrict or dilate to regulate blood flow and help regulate body temperature through radiation and convection. The sympathetic nervous system regulates this process by releasing noradrenaline to dilate blood vessels in response to rising temperatures and constrict them when temperatures drop, retaining heat.
    * Blood pressure: The body regulates blood pressure through a combination of hormonal and neural signals. The kidneys produce a hormone called renin, which stimulates the release of another hormone called angiotensin, which constricts blood vessels to increase blood pressure. The nervous system can also regulate blood pressure by controlling heart rate and blood vessel constriction.
    * Blood glucose levels: The body regulates blood glucose levels through the actions of several hormones, including insulin and glucagon. Insulin is produced by the pancreas and helps to lower blood glucose levels by promoting the uptake and storage of glucose by cells. Glucagon, also produced by the pancreas, helps to raise blood glucose levels by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen into glucose.
    * Hormonal and neural signals: The body uses a combination of hormonal and neural signals to regulate various physiological variables. Hormones, such as insulin and glucagon, are released into the bloodstream and act on target cells to regulate physiological processes. Neural signals, such as those from the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, can also regulate physiological variables by controlling heart rate, blood vessel constriction, and other functions.
  * Detection and response to changes: The body uses feedback mechanisms to detect changes in physiological variables and respond accordingly to maintain homeostasis. These mechanisms involve receptors that detect changes, control centers that process information, and effectors that carry out responses.
  * Adapting to changes: The body can adapt to changes in the internal and external environment to maintain homeostasis. For example, if an individual moves from a cold environment to a warm environment, their body will begin to sweat to maintain a stable body temperature.
  * Coordinated responses: Feedback mechanisms in the body are coordinated to ensure that responses to changes in physiological variables are appropriate and effective. For example, if blood glucose levels rise after a meal, the pancreas will release insulin to help lower blood glucose levels, while the liver will store glucose as glycogen.
  * Importance for health: Homeostasis is essential for good health. Many diseases and disorders result from disruptions in homeostasis. For example, diabetes results from a disruption in the body's ability to regulate blood glucose levels, while hypertension (high blood pressure) is caused by a disruption in the body's ability to regulate blood pressure.
* Cells: Cells are the basic units of life. They carry out all the processes necessary for an organism to survive. There are many different types of cells in the body, each with a specific function.
* Tissues: Tissues are groups of similar cells that work together to perform a specific function. There are four main types of tissues in the body: epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous.
* Organs: Organs are structures made up of different tissues that work together to perform a specific function. For example, the heart is an organ made up of muscle, connective, and nervous tissues that work together to pump blood.
* Systems: Systems are groups of organs that work together to perform a specific function. For example, the cardiovascular system is made up of the heart and blood vessels and is responsible for pumping and circulating blood throughout the body.
* Feedback mechanisms: Feedback mechanisms are processes that regulate physiological functions in the body. There are two main types of feedback mechanisms: negative feedback and positive feedback. Negative feedback mechanisms work to maintain homeostasis by reducing or reversing a change in the body. Positive feedback mechanisms amplify a change in the body, leading to a response that is greater than the initial stimulus.
