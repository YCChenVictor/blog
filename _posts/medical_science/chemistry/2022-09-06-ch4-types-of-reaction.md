## Introduction

This article explains the types of chemical reactions:

* Precipitation reactions: dissolved substances react to form one (or more) solid products
* Acid–base reactions: chemical reaction that occurs between an acid and a base
* Oxidation–reduction reactions: reaction causes the oxidation number of a molecule, atom, or ion changes by gaining or losing an electron

We will start from solubility and then explain these three types of reactions.

## Why?

focus on why we need it

## How?

### Solubility rules

A soluble compound can be dissolved in water.

* Always soluble: $$Na^+, K^+, Li^+, NH_4^+, NO_3^-, C_2H_3O_2^-$$
* Generally Soluble:
  * $$Cl^-, Br^-, I^-$$ (exception: $$Ag^+, Pb^{2+}, Hg_2^{2+}$$)
  * $$SO_4^{2-}$$ (exception: $$Ca^{2+}, Ba^{2+}, Sr^{2+}, Pb^{2+}$$)
* Generally Insoluble:
  * $$OH^-$$ (exception: $$Na^+, NH_4^-, Ca^{2+}, Sr^{2+}, Ba^{2+}$$)
  * $$S^{2-}, CO_3^{2-}, PO_4^{3-}, CrO_4^{2-}$$ (exception: $$Na^+, K^+, Li^+, NH_4^+$$)

#### dissolve

* Water is a polar solvent that dissolves many ionic and polar substances
* Electrolytes: a substance that produces ions in solution when dissolved in water
  * Strong electrolyte: 100% dissociated to produce separate ions; strongly conducts an electric current; example: $$HClO_4$$
  * Weak electrolyte: Only a small percentage of dissolved molecules produce ions; weakly conducts an electric current; example: $$NH_3$$
  * Nonelectrolyte: Dissolved substance produces no ions; does not conduct an electric current; example: $$C_6H_{12}O_6$$

#### molarity

$$Molarity (M) = \frac{moles of solute(mole)}{volumn of solution(L)}$$

example: 0.25 moles of $$NaCl$$ in 300 ml of solution -> M = 0.25/0.3 = 0.83

#### Dilution

Moles of solute after dilution = moles of solute before dilution:

$$M_1V_1 = M_2V_2$$

#### equations

For example, when mixing $$K_2CrO_4$$ and $$Ba(NO_3)_2$$, a reaction to form $$BaCrO_4$$ and dissolve $$KNO_3$$ occurs

* formula equation: $$K_2CrO_4(aq) + Ba(NO_3)_2(aq) -> BaCrO_4(s) + 2KNO_3(aq)$$
* complete ionic equation: $$2K^+(aq) + CrO_4^{2-}(aq) + Ba^{2+}(aq) + 2(NO_3)^-(aq) -> BaCrO_4(s) + 2K^+(aq) + 2NO_3^-(aq)$$
* net ionic equation: $$Ba^{2+}(aq) + CrO_4^{2-}(aq) -> BaCrO_4(s)$$

aq means
s means

### Precipitation reactions

formation of a solid occurs

example: $$AgNO_3(aqueous) + KCl(aqueous) — AgCl(precipitate) + KNO_3(aqueous)$$

### Acid–base reactions

It involves a transfer of $$H^+$$ ions

Three model: Arrhenius ⊆ Brønsted–Lowry ⊆ Lewis

* Arrhenius
  * Acid: produces $$H^+$$
  * Base: produces $$OH^-$$
* Brønsted–Lowry
  * Acid: proton donor
  * Base: proton acceptor
  * proton = $$H^+$$
* Lewis
  * TBC

Please refer to organic_chemistry/2022-08-07-2-acid-and-base.md

#### Titrations

* To calculate the concentration of the solution
* For example, given 20 ml of $$HCl$$ in a bottle, we gradually add $$NaOH$$ and after 48.6 ml of $$NaOH$$ added, the indicator changed color
  * equation: $$HCl + NaOH - H_2O + NaCl$$
  * [$$NaOH$$] = 0.100 M -> we need 0.00486 mol of $$NaOH$$
  * By the equation, mol of $$HCl$$ : mol of $$NaOH$$ = 1 : 1 -> there is also 0.00486 mole of $$Hcl$$ in the 20 ml bottle
  * [$$$HCl$] = 0.00486 / 0.02 = 0.243 M

### Oxidation–reduction reactions

It involves electron transfer

* Oxidation: loss electrons
* Reduction: gain electrons
* oxidation states method (TBC)
