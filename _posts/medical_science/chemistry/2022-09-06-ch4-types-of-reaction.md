* Precipitation reactions: dissolved substances react to form one (or more) solid products
  * dissolve
* Acid–base reactions: chemical reaction that occurs between an acid and a base
* Oxidation–reduction reactions: reaction causes the oxidation number of a molecule, atom, or ion changes by gaining or losing an electron

## Why?

focus on why we need it

## How?

### Precipitation reactions

TBC

#### dissolve

Water is a polar solvent that dissolves many ionic and polar substances

### Acid–base reactions

### Oxidation–reduction reactions

## What?

give an example
