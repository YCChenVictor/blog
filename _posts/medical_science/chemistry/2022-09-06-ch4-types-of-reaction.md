## Introduction

This article explains the types of chemical reactions:

* Precipitation reactions: dissolved substances react to form one (or more) solid products
  * dissolve
* Acid–base reactions: chemical reaction that occurs between an acid and a base
* Oxidation–reduction reactions: reaction causes the oxidation number of a molecule, atom, or ion changes by gaining or losing an electron

## Why?

focus on why we need it

## How?

### Precipitation reactions

solute + solvent = solution

example: $$NaCl + H_2O$$ -> salt solution

#### dissolve

* Water is a polar solvent that dissolves many ionic and polar substances
* Electrolytes: a substance that produces ions in solution when dissolved in water
  * Strong electrolyte: 100% dissociated to produce separate ions; strongly conducts an electric current; example: $$HClO_4$$
  * Weak electrolyte: Only a small percentage of dissolved molecules produce ions; weakly conducts an electric current; example: $$NH_3$$
  * Nonelectrolyte: Dissolved substance produces no ions; does not conduct an electric current; example: $$C_6H_{12}O_6$$

#### molarity

$$Molarity (M) = \frac{moles of solute(mole)}{volumn of solution(L)}$$

example: 0.25 moles of $$NaCl$$ in 300 ml of solution -> M = 0.25/0.3 = 0.83

#### Dilution

Moles of solute after dilution = moles of solute before dilution:

$$M_1V_1 = M_2V_2$$

#### equations

For example, when mixing $$K_2CrO_4$$ and $$Ba(NO_3)_2$$, a reaction to form $$BaCrO_4$$ and dissolve $$KNO_3$$ occurs

* formula equation: $$K_2CrO_4(aq) + Ba(NO_3)_2(aq) -> BaCrO_4(s) + 2KNO_3(aq)$$
* complete ionic equation: $$2K^+(aq) + CrO_4^{2-}(aq) + Ba^{2+}(aq) + 2(NO_3)^-(aq) -> BaCrO_4(s) + 2K^+(aq) + 2NO_3^-(aq)$$
* net ionic equation: $$Ba^{2+}(aq) + CrO_4^{2-}(aq) -> BaCrO_4(s)$$

aq means
s means

### Acid–base reactions

Three model: Arrhenius ⊆ Brønsted–Lowry ⊆ Lewis

* Arrhenius
  * Acid: produces $$H^+$$
  * Base: produces $$OH^-$$
* Brønsted–Lowry
  * Acid: proton donor
  * Base: proton acceptor
  * proton = $$H^+$$
* Lewis
  * TBC
