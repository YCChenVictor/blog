## Introduction

This article describes fundamental knowledge and skills in chemistry as follow:

## Why?

focus on why we need it

## How?

### fundamental laws

* conservation of mass: mass is neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions
* definite proportion: chemical compound always contains its component elements in fixed ratio
* multiple proportions: given two elements form more than one compound, the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will always be ratios of small whole numbers

### Dalton’s atomic theory

* All matter is made of atoms
* All atoms of a given element are identical in mass and properties
* Chemical compounds are formed when atoms combine
* Atoms are not changed in chemical reactions but the way they are bound together
changes

### Atomic structure

* nucleus contains protons (positive charge) and neutrons (no charge)
* electrons reside outside the nucleus
  * electrons, negative charge, small mass (1/1840 of proton)
  * the distance between electrons and nucleus is relatively large
* isotopes have the same atomic number but different mass numbers

### molecules vs compound

When atoms bonds together, it forms molecule. When two different atoms bonds together, it forms compound; actually, compound is a kind of molecules but the atoms must be different. For example, $$H_2O$$ is both molecule and compound but $$O_2$$ is only molecule.

### bonds

Atoms combine to form molecules by sharing electrons to form covalent bonds.

## What?

### conservation of mass

TBC

### definite proportion

For example, $$CO_2$$ has one C (6) and two O (8), so in X grams of $$CO_2$$, there must be X * 6/(6+8*2) grams of O and X * 8*2/(6+8*2) grams of O. The proportion of C/O must be 3/8.

### multiple proportions

For example, in $$CO$$ and $$CO_2$$, given one mass of C, the ratio of O in CO and $$CO_2$$ must be $$1/2$$

### Dalton’s atomic theory
