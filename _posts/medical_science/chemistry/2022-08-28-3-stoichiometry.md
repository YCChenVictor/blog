## Introduction

Stoichiometry: balance the chemical reaction -> derive the proportion of moles in this reaction -> derive the number of required moles to complete the reaction or predict the number of compounds going to be produced after reaction; for exmaple, we know $$SO_2$$ + $$O_2$$ = $$SO_3$$

* step 1: balance

$$2SO_2 + O_2  2SO_3$$

(find the arrow in mathjax docs)

* step 2: proportion

$$SO_2 : O_2 : SO_3 = 2 : 1 : 2$$

* step 3: derive the number of moles; for 4.7 moles of $$SO_2$$, we need 4.7/2 = 2.35 moles of $$O_2$$ to form $$SO_3$$ ... etc

## Why?

focus on why we need it

## How?

focus on the mechanim

## What?

give an example
