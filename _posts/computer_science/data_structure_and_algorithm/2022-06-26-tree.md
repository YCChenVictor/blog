## Introduction

* A tree is composed of nodes.
* Each tree has a root node.
* Each node has zero or more child nodes.
* The data stored in each node has any datatype.
* Three type of traversals: inorder, preorder, postorder

### essential structure

Tree:

```javascript
class Tree {
  constructor() {
    this.root = new TreeNode(key, value);
  }

  preOrderTraversal(node = this.root) { // I should understand the concept first
    
  }

  insert() { // we can only insert node as leaf
    
  }

  remove() {

  }

  find() {

  }
}

class TreeNode {
  constructor(key, value = key, parent = null) {
    this.key = key;
    this.value = value;
    this.parent = parent;
    this.children = [];
  }

  get isLeaf() {
    return this.children === 0;
  }

  get hasChildren() {
    return !this.isLeaf;
  }
}
```

### types of tree

(should replace the image with own drawing after react P5)

please add description in each types of tree

* general tree: each node has 0 to many child node

* binary tree: each node has at most 2 child modes

* balanced tree
* unbalanced tree
* complete binary tee
* full binary tree
* perfect binary tree

### types of traversal

Given a tree as follow:

There are three actions we can do in current node

* visit (return the value of current node)
* left (traverse to the left node)
* right (traverse to the right)

After each traverse, redo it from begin

* inorder traversals (L > V > R): 2 -> 7 -> 5 -> 6 -> 11 -> 1 -> 9 -> 5 -> 9
* preorder traversals (V > L > R): 1 -> 7 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 11 -> 9 -> 9 -> 5
* postorder traversals (L > R > V): 2 -> 5 -> 11 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 9 -> 9 -> 1

Tips: for example, in inorder traversal, the tree with root 7 > root 1 > tree with root 9, so it will traverse the nodes of tree with root 7 first then root 1 then tree with root 9.

## How?

* binary tree example

```bash
        5
      /   \
     3     8
    / \   / \
   2   4 7   9
```

```javascript
class BinaryTree { // try to create binary tree with above values
  constructor(val = null, left = null, right = null) {

  }
}

function createTree(data) {
  if (!data.length) {  // Base case: empty data
    return null;
  }

  const mid = Math.floor(data.length / 2);  // Find middle index of data
  const root = new TreeNode(data[mid]);  // Create root node with middle value

  // Recursively create left and right subtrees
  root.left = createTree(data.slice(0, mid));
  root.right = createTree(data.slice(mid + 1));

  return root;
}

class TreeNode {
  constructor(val = null, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}
```

* create: O(n)
  * using a recursive algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The recursive algorithm traverses each node in the tree exactly once. Specifically, at each level of the recursion, the algorithm creates one node and recursively calls itself twice to create the left and right subtrees. Since each node is created exactly once, the total number of operations performed by the algorithm is proportional to the number of nodes in the tree, which is O(n).
  * Inserting a new node into a binary tree requires finding the correct position for the new node in the tree. In the worst case, this involves traversing the height of the tree, which has a time complexity of O(log n) for a balanced binary tree and O(n) for an unbalanced binary tree.
* read: O(n)
  * Pre-order traversal visits each node in the tree in the order root, left subtree, right subtree. The time complexity of pre-order traversal is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
  * In-order traversal visits each node in the tree in the order left subtree, root, right subtree. The time complexity of in-order traversal is also O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
  * Post-order traversal visits each node in the tree in the order left subtree, right subtree, root. The time complexity of post-order traversal is also O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
  * Level-order traversal visits each node in the tree by level, starting at the root and moving down to each level. The time complexity of level-order traversal is also O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
* update: O(1)
  * Updating a node in a binary tree involves finding the node to be updated and then modifying its value. This can be done in O(1) time once the node has been found (O(n)).
* delete: O(log n) to O(n)
  * Deleting a node from a binary tree requires finding the node to be deleted and then rearranging the tree to maintain its properties. In the worst case, this also involves traversing the height of the tree, which has a time complexity of O(log n) for a balanced binary tree and O(n) for an unbalanced binary tree.
