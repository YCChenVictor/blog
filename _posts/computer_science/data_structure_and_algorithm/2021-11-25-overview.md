## Introduction

Before we dive into it, please understand concept of [complexity]({{site.baseurl}}/dsa/2022/05/02/complexity.html). Data structures describe how data can be organized, stored, and manipulated. Some common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables. Algorithms are procedures for solving problems such as searching for information, sorting data, processing graphs, performing calculations, and many other tasks.

* Structure
  * array, arraylist, string
  * linked list
  * stack
  * queue
  * tree
  * graph
  * hash table
  * ...
* Most common algorithms (according to ChatGPT)
  * string
    * reversing a string
    * string is a palindrome
    * longest common prefix
  * array
    * finding the maximum subarray
    * binary search
    * sorting an array
      * merge sort
      * quick sort
  * dynamic programming
    * longest increasing subsequence
    * 0/1 knapsack problem
  * Graph traversal
    * shortest path between two nodes
    * detecting cycles in a graph
  * ...
* key concepts (according to cracking the coding interview)
  * bit Manipulation
  * memory (stack vs. heap)
  * recursion
  * dynamic programming
  * big O about time and space complexity

## Why

To solve problem in a more efficient way, making no more space to improve both the time complexity and space complexity.

## How

We can decompose all the programming logics into four actions:

* create (insert)
* read (access with id)
* update (access with attributes)
* delete (delete)

| (time complexity) | (arraylist) | (linkedlist) | (stack) | (queue) | (trees) |
| :--- | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| C | O(1) - O(n) | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | O(n) |
| R | O(1) | O(n) | O(1) | O(1) | O(n) |
| U | O(1) | O(n) | O(1) | O(n) | O(1) |
| D | O(1) - O(n) | O(n) | O(1) | O(1) | O(log(n)) - O(n) |

* code example

```javascript
class Graph {
  constructor() {
    this.nodes = new Map();
  }

  addNode(node) {
    this.nodes.set(node, []);
  }

  addEdge(nodeA, nodeB) {
    if (!this.nodes.has(nodeA)) {
      this.addNode(nodeA);
    }
    if (!this.nodes.has(nodeB)) {
      this.addNode(nodeB);
    }
    this.nodes.get(nodeA).push(nodeB);
    this.nodes.get(nodeB).push(nodeA);
  }

  getNeighbors(node) {
    return this.nodes.get(node);
  }
}

// Create a new graph
const graph = new Graph();

// Add nodes and edges to the graph
graph.addEdge("A", "B");
graph.addEdge("B", "C");
graph.addEdge("C", "D");
graph.addEdge("D", "E");
graph.addEdge("E", "F");
graph.addEdge("F", "G");
graph.addEdge("G", "A");

// Get the neighbors of node "C"
const neighborsOfC = graph.getNeighbors("C");
console.log(neighborsOfC); // Output: ["B", "D"]
```

### hash table

to be continued (extract)

The data flow:

<div class="mermaid">
graph LR
  id1(value 1) --> id4(hash<br>function)
  id2(value 2) --> id4(hash<br>function)
  id3(value 3) --> id4(hash<br>function)

  id4(hash<br>function) -- insert value 1 --> id5(key 0)
  id4(hash<br>function) -- insert value 2 --> id7(key 1)
  id4(hash<br>function) -- insert value 3 --> id7(key 2)
  subgraph Buckets
    id5(key 0)
    id6(key 1)
    id7(key 2)
    id8(key 3)
    ...
  end

  id5(key 0) --> id9(value 1)
  id7(key 2) --> id10(value 2)
  id10(value 2) --> id11(value 3)
</div>

The value will be calculated by certain method in hash function to get the key of buckets and then connects the value with linked list if the mapping key is the same.

Given the length of buckets is N, meaning there are N keys, if we want to search an element, it will first pass the element into hash function to get the key for certain linked list and then search through the linked list.

The time complexity = $$O(A + B)$$, where A is the length of bucket and B is the length of linked list. A is actually 1 because the magic of hash function and B is usually close to 1 if we making the collisions, meaning values map to same key, as low as possible. As a result, the time complexity is actually $$O(1)$$

### dynamic programming

to be continued (extract)

When we need to solve the optimal subproblem in the substructure of the whole structure. The optimal solution can be composed of optimal solutions to its subproblems.

A tyical example: Maximum subarray sum

Please return the sub array that has biggest sum

```javascript
function maxSubarraySum(arr) {
  const dp = [];
  dp[0] = arr[0];
  let maxSum = dp[0];
  
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    dp[i] = Math.max(arr[i], dp[i - 1] + arr[i]);
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, dp[i]);
  }
  
  return maxSum;
}

// Example usage:
const array = [1, -3, 2, 1, -1];
const result = maxSubarraySum(array); // Returns 3
```

By storing the solutions to the subproblems, dynamic programming can avoid redundant calculations and improve the overall efficiency of the algorithm.
