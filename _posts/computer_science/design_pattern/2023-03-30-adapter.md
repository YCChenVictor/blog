## Introduction

The Adapter pattern allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by creating a class that acts as an interface between them. The adapter class maps the methods of one interface to another, making it possible for the two interfaces to communicate.

Three components
* Client: The client is the component that is trying to use the adaptee, but cannot do so directly because the adaptee's interface is incompatible with the client's interface
* Adapter: The adapter is a class that acts as a bridge between the client and the adaptee. It maps the methods of the adaptee to the methods of the client.
* Adaptee: The adaptee is the component that the client wants to use, but cannot do so directly because its interface is incompatible with the client's interface.

## Why?

* Reuse an existing class that does not match the interface of the client
* Create a class that can work with multiple incompatible classes

## How?

### example in javascript

```javascript
// First Adaptee - the complex class that needs to be adapted
class LegacyPaymentProcessor {
  constructor() {
    this.total = 0;
  }

  addLegacyPayment(amount) {
    this.total += amount;
  }

  getLegacyTotal() {
    return this.total;
  }
}

// Second Adaptee - another complex class that needs to be adapted
class ModernPaymentProcessor {
  constructor() {
    this.total = 0;
  }

  addModernPayment(amount) {
    this.total += amount;
  }

  getModernTotal() {
    return this.total;
  }
}

// Adapter - the class that adapts the interface of the Adaptees
class PaymentAdapter {
  constructor(adaptee) {
    this.adaptee = adaptee;
  }

  processPayment(amount) {
    if (this.adaptee instanceof LegacyPaymentProcessor) {
      this.adaptee.addLegacyPayment(amount);
    } else if (this.adaptee instanceof ModernPaymentProcessor) {
      this.adaptee.addModernPayment(amount);
    }
  }

  getAmount() {
    if (this.adaptee instanceof LegacyPaymentProcessor) {
      return this.adaptee.getLegacyTotal();
    } else if (this.adaptee instanceof ModernPaymentProcessor) {
      return this.adaptee.getModernTotal();
    }
  }
}

// Client code that uses the PaymentAdapter with two Adaptees
const legacyPaymentProcessor = new LegacyPaymentProcessor();
const modernPaymentProcessor = new ModernPaymentProcessor();
const paymentAdapter1 = new PaymentAdapter(legacyPaymentProcessor);
const paymentAdapter2 = new PaymentAdapter(modernPaymentProcessor);
paymentAdapter1.processPayment(100);
paymentAdapter2.processPayment(200);
console.log(paymentAdapter1.getAmount()); // Output: 100
console.log(paymentAdapter2.getAmount()); // Output: 200
```
