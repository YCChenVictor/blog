## Introduction

This article describes the concept of visitor design pattern, which separates common operations with the objects performing those operations; for example, visitors are the **employees** of a restaurant and the common operation is **greeting**.

* We want all different types of employees to use same greeting

<div id='visitor' class='h-screen justify-center items-center'>
  <div id='visitor_toggle_erase' class=''></div>
  <div id='visitor_image_save' class=''></div>
  <div id='visitor_canvas' class='border'></div>
</div>

<script>
  const id = 'visitor'
  let binarySearchTree = p5Draw(id)
  let binarySearchTreeP5 = new p5(binarySearchTree, id);
</script>

## Why?

By modifying the common operations method, all objects using the common operations behaves consistently.

* pros:
  * Open/Closed Principle: we can introduce new methods to objects without changing the classes of these objects
  * Single Responsibility Principle: we can define related operations in one class
  * visitor object collects common information in one class, easier to compare different behaviors

* cons:
  * When number of objects changes, we need to update all the common operations

## How?

The Structure:

## What?

when a customer walk into a restaurant, we want both manager and clerk to greet with special slogan and then self introductions and serve meals with same pose but different kind of professions.

* With visitor pattern, we can change special slogan and poses day by day without break the classes of objects.

```ruby
class Employee # Element
  def accept(_visitor)
    raise NotImplementedError, "#{self.class} has not implemented method '#{__method__}'"
  end
end

class Manager < Employee
  def accept(visitor)
    visitor.manager(self)
  end

  def status
    'Manager'
  end

  def profession
    'order meal'
  end
end

class Clerk < Employee
  def accept(visitor)
    visitor.clerk(self)
  end

  def status
    'Clerk'
  end

  def profession
    'make meal'
  end
end

class Visitor
  def manager(_element)
    raise NotImplementedError, "#{self.class} has not implemented method '#{__method__}'"
  end

  def clerk(_element)
    raise NotImplementedError, "#{self.class} has not implemented method '#{__method__}'"
  end
end

class SayHi < Visitor
  def manager(element)
    puts "#{self.special_slogan}, I am #{element.status}"
  end

  def clerk(element)
    puts "#{self.special_slogan}, I am #{element.status}"
  end

  def special_slogan
    'Special Slogan this week!'
  end
end

class ServeMeal < Visitor
  def manager(element)
    puts "#{self.same_pose}, and then #{element.profession}"
  end

  def clerk(element)
    puts "#{self.same_pose}, and then #{element.profession}"
  end

  def same_pose
    'dance dance dance'
  end
end

def client_code(components, visitor)
  components.each do |component|
    component.accept(visitor)
  end
end

components = [Manager.new, Clerk.new]

say_hi = SayHi.new
client_code(components, say_hi)

serve_meal = ServeMeal.new
client_code(components, serve_meal)
```
