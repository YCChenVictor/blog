## Introduction

This article describes the concepts behind hashing algorithms:

* MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5): TBC
* SHA (Secure Hash Algorithms): a family of cryptographic hash functions
  * SHA-0
  * SHA-1
  * SHA-2
  * SHA-3
* scrypt
* bcrypt

## Why?

focus on why we need it

## How?

### SHA-1

Suppose we want to encode 'abc' with SHA-1

steps:




## What?

give an example
