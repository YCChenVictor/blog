## Introduction

This article describes the related concepts of web security. By OWASP, the top 10 attack methods:

* cross site scripting (XSS): Attacks client side. Attacker injects **javascript** to a webpage through legal inputs and browsers run it and get sick; for example, keeping alerting a message.
  * refletced: only on client side
  * stored: stored into database and affects all other browsers querying it
  * DOM: TBC
  * mutation: TBC
* injection flaws: Attacks server side. Attacker injects SQL commands to a webpage through legal inputs and server runs it and get sick; for example, remove data stored in database.
* remote file inclusion: TBC
* insecure direct object reference: Attackers can get information by changing parameters sent to server. To solve it, we use session in cookie to store currently logged-in user and only response the data related to this user.
* Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Attackers can hide malware in seeable places for logged-in (which gives you the session) users to click it and then sent unwanted requests to server with the session in cookie.
* Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling: TBC
* Broken Authentication and Session Management: TBC
* Insecure Cryptographic Storage: TBC
* Insecure Communication: TBC
* Failure to Restrict URL Access: TBC

## Why?

focus on why we need it

## How?

This section will explain the mechanisms of each attack so that we can have deeper understanding about how to solve it in what section.
