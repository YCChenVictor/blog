## Introduction

This article describes the related concepts of web security. By OWASP, the top 10 attack methods:

* cross site scripting (XSS): Attacks client side. Attacker injects **javascript** to a webpage through legal inputs and browsers run it and get sick
* injection flaws: Attacks server side. Attacker injects SQL commands to a webpage through legal inputs and server runs it and get sick
* remote file inclusion: TBC
* insecure direct object reference: Attackers can get information by changing parameters sent to server. To solve it, we use session in cookie to store currently logged-in user and only response the data related to this user.
* Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Attackers can hide malware in seeable places for logged-in (which gives you the session) users to click it and then sent unwanted requests to server with the session in cookie.
* Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling: TNC
* Broken Authentication and Session Management: TBC
* Insecure Cryptographic Storage: TBC
* Insecure Communication: TBC
* Failure to Restrict URL Access: TBC

## Why?

Prevent malware

## How?

This section will explain the mechanisms of each attack so that we can have deeper understanding about how to solve it in what section.

### cross site scripting (XSS)

Attacks client side. Attacker injects **javascript** to a webpage through legal inputs and browsers run it and get sick; for example, keeping alerting a message.

* refletced: only on client side
* stored: stored into database and affects all other browsers querying it
* DOM: TBC
* mutation: TBC

### injection flaws

injection flaws: Attacks server side. Attacker injects SQL commands to a webpage through legal inputs and server runs it and get sick; for example, remove data stored in database.

### insecure direct object reference

insecure direct object reference: Attackers can get information by changing parameters sent to server. To solve it, we use session in cookie to store currently logged-in user and only response the data related to this user.

### Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Attackers can hide malware in seeable places for logged-in users, who have sessions and is authenticated, to click it and then sent unwanted requests to server with the session in cookie.

Solutions:

* Synchronizer Token Pattern: This method adds a unique token to each HTTP request, which the server then verifies before processing the request.
* Same-Site Cookies: This method sets the SameSite attribute of a cookie, which tells the browser to only send the cookie with requests made on the same website.
* Double Submit Cookies: This method adds a unique token to both the cookie and the form data, and then verifies that they match on the server.
* Recaptcha v3
* Use of frameworks that have built-in CSRF protection mechanisms.

## What?

### CSRF

I want to use the [concept of JWT]({{site.baseurl}}/api/2022/08/17/authentication.html#jwt) because JWT check token on each request, which naturally prevent CSRF. However, it may encounter XSS because now the token is accessible on frontend. But react itself can prevent it.

With the JWT design, we can disable CORS checks as follow in node

```javascript
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  // Website you wish to allow to connect
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://localhost:3000');
  // Request methods you wish to allow
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, DELETE');
  // Request headers you wish to allow
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'X-Requested-With,content-type');
  // Set to true if you need the website to include cookies in the requests sent to the API (e.g. in case you use sessions)
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', true);
  // Pass to next layer of middleware
  next();
});
```
