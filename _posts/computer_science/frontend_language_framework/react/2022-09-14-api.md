## Introduction

This article explains how to use react as frontend to get twitter data.

## Why?

I need twitter posts for world building.

## How?

### envrionment

Create a file, `server.js`

### GET

In `server.js`

```jsx
const rulesURL = new URL(
    "https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/stream/rules"
  );

  const requestConfig = {
    url: rulesURL,
    auth: {
      bearer: token,
    },
    json: true,
  };
```

### backend

Because react hides nothing and Same-Origin Policy of twitter api, we still need a backend to hide tokens and to build proxy for react to get and post. (refer to 2022-08-30-top-10-risks.md for further information)

Please refer to ...

## What?

## Note

Try to get data from twitter api:

* how to hide token -> 
* how to build get? -> use fetch
