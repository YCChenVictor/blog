## Introduction

This article describes basic concepts related to react with topics:

* start a project
* third party library
* concept of component
* concept of routes
* events
* basic commands

and with a demo result:

<img src='/assets/img/react_simple_calculator.png' class='w-1/2' alt='react_simple_calculator'>

## Why?

React:

* is a component framework, managing states and keep track of when the component should be updated
* has no idea what a browser is

## How?

### start a project

```bash
npx create-react-app@latest your-project-name --use-npm
cd your-project-name
npm start
```

remove all the files in `/src` and add `index.js` in it with following code:

```javascript
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'

const element = <h1>Hello World</h1>;
createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  element
)
```

which will create a JS object and render it into the DOM with id = root in the `public/index.html`

### third party library

just install it with `npm install xxx` and follow the official guides such as [install tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)

for more detail please refer to: 2021-06-14-third-party-library

### concept of component

A component should include

* HTML & CSS: the styles
* relationship between states and events
  * useState
    * define how state changes and store the value when an event occur and **rerender** component to show the effect
    * example: `<button onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}> increment </button>`
  * useEffect
    * define customized effects and trigger it **when rerender** component
  * useRef: two usages
    * store value of reference and it will not rerender component when value changed
    * serve as reference of current component
  * useContext: TBC
* class & lifecycle vs hooks: TBC

For more detailed disscussion, please refer to 2021-06-15-react-component-and-prop.md

A really basic component: in `src`, create `components/counter.jsx` with

```javascript
import React, { useState, useRef } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  // should add two example of useRef

  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <span>
        {count}
      </span>
      <button
        onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}
      >
        Increment
      </button>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
 
export default Counter;
```

### concept of routes

Add required library

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

import it with

```jsx
import {
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Routes,
  Route,
  Link
} from "react-router-dom";
```

and use it

```jsx
<Router>
  <div>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/users">Users</Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/about">
        <About />
      </Route>
      <Route path="/users">
        <Users />
      </Route>
      <Route path="/">
        <Home />
      </Route>
    </Routes>
  </div>
</Router>
```

## What?

### decompose app into tree

The tree of this app:

<div class="mermaid">
graph TB
  id1((App)) --> id2((navbar))
  id1((App)) --> id4((counter))
  id4((counter)) --> id5((reset))
  id4((counter)) --> id6((row))
  id6((row)) --> id7((total))
  id6((row)) --> id8((plus))
  id6((row)) --> id9((minus))
  id6((row)) --> id10((delete))
</div>

all the nodes represent a component

### hello world

please refer to start project in how section

### component

Here I only show how to make a workable component for this app. For more concepts, please refer to 2021-06-15-component-and-prop.md

Add a component file with file name: `components/counter.jsx` in the `src` path and the coding as follow:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <span>
        {count}
      </span>
      <button
        onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}
      >
        Increment
      </button>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
 
export default Counter;
```

You can change the value of count and see the effect on the webpage.

import this component in `./src/index.html` and render it as follow:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Counter from `./components/counter`;

ReactDOM.render(<Counter />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### events

In the component section, you can see button for increments, the `onClick` defines what method to be executed once users click the button; for example, we can have a following button

```jsx
handleIncrement() {
  console.log('Increment Clicked');
}

<button
  onClick={this.handleIncrement}
>
```

Then it will log the string, Increment Clicked, in console once user clicks the button; however, if we want to change the state with this function, we need to change the method into

```jsx
handleIncrement = () => {
  console.log('Increment Clicked', this);
}
```

so that this method can get the `this` in javascript or use `constructor` in the class, `Component` as follow

```jsx
constructor() {
  super();
  this.handleIncrement = this.handleIncrement.bind(this);
}

handleIncrement() {
  console.log('Increment Clicked', this);
}
```

See 2021-06-16-life-cycle.md for further discussion. So the following function can change the `count` state when button been clicked

```jsx
handleIncrement = () => {
  this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
}
```

Once user click the button and trigger the `handleIncrement`, react will change the state in virtual DOM -> compare the new virtual DOM and the old virtual DOM to know the key difference -> update the place with different values compared by virtual DOMs in real DOM. See 2021-06-15-component-and-prop.md for further discussion about how virtual DOM and real DOM work in react.

#### passing arguments

If we want to pass arguments to the event handler function, we can do the following:

```jsx
handleIncrement = (product) => {
  console.log(product)
  this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
}
onClick={() => this.handleIncrement({ id: 1 })}
```

Actually, I do not know why we need to write it as showing above. I will dive into it.

### basic commands

1. run project: `npm start`
