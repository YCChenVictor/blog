## Introduction

Refactoring, the process of changing the code without changing the behavior, meaning with test for key features ready.

## Why

1. Maintainability
2. Extensibility

## How

### Maintainability

1. name more appropriate variables and methods
2. decompose method into single-purpose methods
3. move methods to a more appropriate class
4. remove misleading comments

### Extensibility

With well maintainable coding base and the concept of design pattern, we can achieve some features with methods restructuring and combining.

## What

I need more practical experience.
