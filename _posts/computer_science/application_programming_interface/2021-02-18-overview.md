## Introduction

Application programming interface is set of rules to interact with software.

## Why

With API, developers can access the functionality of one system from within another system, without having to know the details of how the underlying system works.

## How

The concept of CRUD (create, read, update, delete) maps to POST, GET, PATCH/PUT, DELETE in HTTP.

### rails

* POST /events -> /events/create -> events#create
* GET /events/1 -> /events/show/1 -> events#show
* PATCH /events/1 -> /events/update/1 -> events#update
* DELETE /events/1 -> /events/destroy/1 -> events#destroy

HTML now can only use GET and POST; as a result, rails adds params, method=PATCH and method=DELETE in POST for PATCH and DELETE.

refer to [rails API]({{site.baseurl}}/rails/2022/02/05/routes.html)

### node

```javascript
axios({
    method: 'post',
    url: 'url',
    data: formData, // maps to curl -d
    headers: { // maps to curl -H
      'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data'
    }
  })
  .then((response) => {
    //handle success
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch((response) => {
    //handle error
    console.log(response);
  });
```

### REST

refer to [concept of REST]({{site.baseurl}}/api/2023/01/22/restful.html)

### frontend vs backend

If you need to make the API requests private, then put it on backend. Always create frontend first because UI/UX is more important.

## What

### curl

Just place the basic commands here because I usually use postman.

```bash
# create
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"name\": \"John Doe\"}" localhost:8080/api/students

# read

# update

# delete
```

### Postman

#### GET

#### POST

[Create a POST Request](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postman/postman_post_requests.htm)

#### JWT

I think we can have more JWT designs here.
