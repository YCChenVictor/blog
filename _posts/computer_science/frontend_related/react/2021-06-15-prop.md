## Introduction

This article

## Why

We can pass variable from parent node to children node

## How

```jsx
function ParentComponent() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("Hello from the parent component!");
  return <ChildComponent message={message} />;
}

function ChildComponent(props) {
  return <div>{props.message}</div>;
}
```

### call parent method in children

check `useContext` in hook

### prop vs state (TBC)

`state` can only be used in the component itself and `prop` is passed to the component from outside. We cannot modify the prop directly in the component class; instead we need to pass the `prop` to `state` and then modify the `state` within the component.

Because `state` can only be used in the component itself, we can only add the modify method in the component using the state; for example, in `counters`, add `handleDelete` as follow

```javascript
class Counters extends Component {
  ...
  handleDelete = () => {
    console.log('Delete the counter')
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.state.counters.map(counter =>
          <Counter
            ...
            onDelete={this.handleDelete} 
            ...
          >
            ...
          </Counter>
        )}
      </div>
    );
  ...
}
```

and add a button for deletion in class `Counter` as follow

```jsx
class Counter extends Component {
  ...
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button
          className="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"
          onClick={() => this.props.onDelete()}
        >
          Delete
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ...
}
```

When we click delete button in `<Counter>`, it will trigger `handleDelete` in `Counters`
