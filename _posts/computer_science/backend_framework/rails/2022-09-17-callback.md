### Model Callback

Callback means adding some methods (hooks) to the life cycle of data in database.

For example, the process of save in rails:
<img src="/assets/img/rails_model_callback.png" alt="">

If we want to have an encrypted email before email creation. Then,
```
require 'digest'

class User < ActiveRecord::Base  
  before_create :encrypt_email  
    
  private  
  def encrypt_email  
    self.email = Digest::MD5.hexdigest(email)  
  end  
end
```
for more callback methods, please refer to [**Active Record Callbacks - Ruby on Rails Guides**]("https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_callbacks.html")
