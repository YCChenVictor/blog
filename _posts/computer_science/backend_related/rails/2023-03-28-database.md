## Introduction

There are several topics in rails related to database:

* Database migrations: Manage changes to the database schema. Migrations are written in Ruby and allow you to make changes to the database schema while keeping track of the changes over time.
* Associations: Allow you to define relationships between different database tables. For example, a user may have many blog posts, and each blog post belongs to a user.
* Querying: Rails provides a query interface called ActiveRecord::Relation, which allows you to build and execute database queries. This interface is based on a fluent API, which makes it easy to chain query methods and build complex queries.
  * Indexing: Indexes are used to speed up database queries by creating a data structure that allows for fast lookups. In Rails, you can create indexes on specific columns in your database tables to optimize query performance.
* Validations: Validations allow you to define constraints on the data stored in your database. For example, you can validate that a user's email address is unique or that a password meets certain complexity requirements.

## Why?

Because web application framework relies heavily on databases to store and manage application data.

* Databases play a critical role in storing, managing, and retrieving data that is used by web applications. They provide a structured way to store and organize data, allowing web applications to scale and handle large amounts of data efficiently.
* Learning how to work with databases in Ruby on Rails is essential for building effective web applications that can handle large amounts of data and scale to meet the needs of users. A strong understanding of database concepts and best practices will enable developers to design and build robust, reliable, and scalable Rails applications.

## How?

### Migration

#### Create

* create_table - creates a new database table

To add model, `Article` with columns: title, content, is_online

```bash
rails g model Article title content:text is_online:boolean
```

* To remove invoke while generating, `--no-helper --no-assets --no-controller-specs --no-view-specs` or

```bash
# application.rb
config.generators.assets = false
config.generators.helper = false
```

Then in db/migrate, timestamp_create_articles.rb:

```ruby
class CreateArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]  
  def change  
    create_table :articles do |t|  
      t.string :title  
      t.text :content  
      t.boolean :is_online  
        
      t.timestamps  
    end  
  end  
end
```

* timestamp for recording `:created_at, :updated_at`

#### Update

* rename_table - renames an existing database table
* add_column - adds a new column to an existing database table
* remove_column - removes a column from an existing database table
* rename_column - renames a column in an existing database table
* change_column - changes the data type or options of a column in an existing database table
* add_index - adds a new index to a database table
* remove_index - removes an existing index from a database table
* add_reference - adds a foreign key reference to an existing database table
* remove_reference - removes a foreign key reference from an existing database table
* change_table - allows you to make multiple changes to an existing database table in a single migration
* reversible - creates a reversible migration that can be rolled back
* up - defines the changes to be made to the database schema when the migration is run
* down - defines how to revert the changes made by the migration

A typical migration file:

```ruby
class AddAgeToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def up
    add_column :users, :age, :integer
  end

  def down
    remove_column :users, :age
  end
end
```

* Ruby file that contains two methods: up and down
  * Up method is used to define the changes you want to make to the database schema
  * Down method is used to define how to undo those changes
* Migration is like version control of database
* Any changes related to database schema will be recorded in migrations with Ruby DSL * The summary of the changes of migration is in `schema.rb`

To run migration:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

To undo:

```bash
rails db:rollback STEP=3
```

However, the Rollback method is not recommended. We should use another migration to modify database to what we want; for example, if we want to **add a column** to an existed table, we can add another generate migration

#### Delete

* drop_table - drops an existing database table

To delete migration files,

```bash
rails d migration MigrationName
```

Notice! please do it only before `db:migrate`

#### Other

* execute - executes a custom SQL statement

If we want to know which migration ever be executed

```ruby
$ rails db:migrate:status
```

### Associations

With the `add_reference`, we can add association to two tables. One-to-many association between a User model and a Post model using migration files:

```ruby
class AddUserRefToPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    add_reference :posts, :user, null: false, foreign_key: true
  end
end
```

* `add_reference` adds a new column called user_id to the posts table
* `:user` tells Rails this column should be a foreign key reference to the User model
* `null: false` ensures that every post must belong to a user
* `foreign_key: true` enforces referential integrity

By using migration files to establish associations between models, you can ensure that your database schema is consistent and follows best practices for data modeling. You can also take advantage of Rails' powerful query interface to query data across multiple tables using associations.

Remember to declare `has_many` and `belongs_to` on `User` and `Post`

### querying

* Time is money, how to query fast plays key role
* In rails, we use active record to query and it uses ORM
* [active record]({{site.baseurl}}/rails/2021/06/10/active-record.html)
  * scopes: help you DRY up your code and make it more readable by abstracting away common conditions
  * associations: methods like has_many, belongs_to, and has_and_belongs_to_many to define associations, and then use these associations in your queries
  * Arel is a SQL AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) manager that is used internally by Active Record. Arel provides a powerful DSL (Domain-Specific Language) that you can use to construct complex SQL queries.
* SQL: Rails also provides methods to execute SQL queries directly
* Performance: You can use tools like the includes method to eager load associations and reduce the number of database queries, and the joins method to perform more efficient SQL joins.
* Debugging queries: Rails provides several tools to help you debug queries, including the to_sql method, which lets you see the SQL generated by your Active Record queries, and the explain method, which shows you the execution plan for a query.

#### performance

* Avoid N+1 queries: One of the most common performance issues in Rails is the N+1 query problem. This occurs when you load a collection of records, and then load a related association for each record individually. To avoid this problem, use the includes method to eagerly load associations; for example, instead of doing:

```ruby
@posts = Post.all
@posts.each do |post|
  puts post.comments.count
end
```

You can do:

```ruby
@posts = Post.includes(:comments).all
@posts.each do |post|
  puts post.comments.count
end
```

This will load all the comments for all the posts in a single query, rather than issuing a separate query for each post.

We can set condition with chaining as follow:

```ruby
@posts = Post.includes(comments: [:user]).where(comments: { approved: true }, users: { admin: true })
```

And include = preload + eager_load: to be continued

* Use indexes: Indexes can significantly improve the performance of your queries by reducing the amount of time it takes to find and retrieve records. Use the add_index method in your migrations to add indexes to your database tables. For example, to add an index to the email column in a users table, you can do:

```ruby
class AddIndexToUsersEmail < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    add_index :users, :email
  end
end
```

Once added an index to a table, use the newly created index in your queries to improve their performance.

```ruby
users = User.where(email: 'john@example.com')
```

This query will use the index on the email column to quickly find the matching record(s) in the users table.

The SQL script of querying remains the same as

```SQL
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'john@example.com';
```

The speed of a SQL query can be faster after adding an index because an index provides a more efficient way for MySQL to locate the rows that match the conditions in the query. MySQL will use the index on the email column to quickly locate the rows that match the condition email = 'john@example.com'. MySQL will read only the index pages that contain the relevant data, and retrieve the matching rows from the table using the row ID stored in the index. This is much faster than scanning every row in the users table to find the matching rows.

#### Index Page

An index in MySQL consists of one or more index pages, which are stored separately from the data pages that contain the actual table rows. Each index page contains a subset of the index data, and includes information about the location of the corresponding rows in the data pages.

The example:

```
Index page 1:
--------------
email                | row ID
---------------------
john@example.com     | 1
jane@example.com     | 2
jim@example.com      | 3
...

Index page 2:
--------------
email                | row ID
---------------------
kim@example.com      | 4
kevin@example.com    | 5
katie@example.com    | 6
...
```

Each index page contains a list of email addresses and their corresponding row IDs.

In the SELECT,

```SQL
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'john@example.com';
```

MySQL will read the index pages for the email column, and locate the row ID for the user with email address "john@example.com". MySQL will then retrieve the corresponding row from the data pages using the row ID. The use of the index pages can make this query much faster than if MySQL had to scan the entire table to find the user with email address "john@example.com".

* Use database-specific features: Different databases have different features and optimizations that you can take advantage of. For example, PostgreSQL has a feature called partial indexes that can improve the performance of queries that only need to retrieve a subset of records.
* Use caching: Caching can be a powerful tool to improve the performance of your queries. Rails provides several caching mechanisms, including fragment caching, action caching, and page caching. Use caching judiciously, as it can also introduce its own set of challenges.
* Use pluck and select: When you only need a specific set of attributes from a collection of records, use the pluck or select methods to retrieve only those attributes, rather than retrieving the entire record.

For example, instead of doing:

```ruby
@users = User.all
@user_emails = @users.map(&:email)
```

do

```ruby
@user_emails = User.pluck(:email)
```

This will retrieve only the email attribute for all the users, rather than retrieving the entire user record.

These are just a few tips to help you optimize the performance of your queries in Rails. There are many other factors to consider, such as database tuning, query optimization, and server configuration. It's important to carefully monitor and profile your application to identify performance bottlenecks and make informed decisions about how to optimize your queries.

#### sub query

### Schema

* A representation of your database's structure
* defined in a file called schema.rb in the db directory
* As more models and migrations, the schema file is updated to reflect the changes
* example:

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Schema.define(version: 2022_01_01_000000) do

  create_table "users", force: :cascade do |t|
    t.string "email"
    t.string "password_digest"
    t.timestamps
  end

  create_table "posts", force: :cascade do |t|
    t.string "title"
    t.text "content"
    t.references "user", foreign_key: true
    t.timestamps
  end
end
```

When you run migrations in your Rails application, they are used to modify the database schema. Each migration corresponds to a specific change to the schema, such as adding a new table or column, renaming a table, or modifying a column's data type. When you run rails db:migrate, Rails applies all of the migrations that haven't been run yet to bring your database schema up to date with your application's current state.
