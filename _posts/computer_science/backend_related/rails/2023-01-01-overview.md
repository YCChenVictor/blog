## Introduction

* Open-source web application framework in the Ruby
* Follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern
  * Model, representing the data and logic of the application
  * View, providing the user interface
  * Controller, handling user input and interacts with the model and view
* Make programming web applications easier by providing a set of conventions and abstractions that eliminate much of the repetitive work involved in building web applications from scratch
  * ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system for interacting with databases
  * Routing system for handling incoming requests
  * Testing framework for writing automated tests
* Convention over configuration, which means that it comes with sensible defaults and assumptions that can be overridden if necessary, but in general, makes it easier for developers to get started quickly and focus on building their application logic rather than configuring the framework
* Rails has a large and active community of developers and contributors, which means that there are many resources available for learning and troubleshooting, as well as a wide range of third-party plugins and libraries that can be used to extend its functionality.
