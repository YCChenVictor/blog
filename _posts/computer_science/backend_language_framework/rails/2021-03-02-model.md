## Introduction

This article describes the concept of model and what's the feature in it.

The statement in documentation: a model is a Ruby class that is used to represent data. Additionally, models can interact with the application's database through a feature of Rails called Active Record.

* Conventions
* Represent data (object)
* Interact with database

## Why

With model, we can use consistent commands to communicate with all type of databases such as MySQL, Postgresql, …etc.

## How

### Conventions

| model name | table name |
| :--- | :--- |
| User | users |

### Represent data (object)

Any business logic and features of an object should be put in this section.

* relation
* validation and callback

#### relation

TBC

### Interact with database

If executing the code trigger SQL command, then put it in this section.

* ORM
* migration
* syntactic saccharine

#### ORM (Object Relational Mapping)

Rails use active record to design ORM. Please refer to xxx for further information.

#### migration

Migration is like version control for the database. Any changes related to database schema will be recorded in migrations with Ruby DSL. And the summary of the changes of migration is in `schema.rb`.

#### syntactic saccharine

How rails design it?

* scope
* TBC

## What

### Example of Represent data

* relation
* validation
* callback

#### example of relation

Please refer to 2021-03-03-relation.md

#### example of validation

Please refer to 2021-03-04-va

### Example of Interact with database

* ORM

#### ORM

ORM helps user to communicate with database with the concept of object.

* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete

In create,

For example, to create a candidate
```
user = Candidate.new(name: "aaa", age: 19)  
user.save
```
In rails console,
<img src="/assets/img/1__jx8nDAU03C8YyqV3WcmK__g.png" alt="r">

In read,

```ruby
User.all
```

means

```SQL
SELECT * FROM users;
```

##### R (Read)

Get the first candidate:
```
Candidate.first
```
Get the top three candidate:
```
Candidate.first(3)
```
find data by id:
```
Candidate.find(1)  
Candidate.find_by(id: 1)
```
Read all data
```
Candidate.all
```
Set some condition with where
```
Candidate.where("age > 18", gender: "female")
```
Set some condition just like aggregation in SQL
```
Candidate.count  
Candidate.sum(:age)
```
Find all table name
```
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.tables
```

#### U (Update)

For example, for changing the candidate’s name with id = 1, in rails console,
```
candidate = Candidate.find\_by(id: 1)  
candidate.name = "hahaha"  
candidate.save
```
or using update directly
```
candidate.update(name: "hahahaha", age: 20)
```
#### D (Delete)

For example, if I want to delete the candidate with id = 1
```
Candidate.destroy(1)
```
or
```
Candidate.delete(1)
```
we also can do it with condition
```
Candidate.destroy_all("id = 1")
```
Notice! `delete` will call the SQL delete directly, so there will not be any callback generated and the other data dependently related to this deleted data will not be deleted too; of course, by ignoring callback and relation, `delete` is faster than `destroy`.

#### Scope

Given we want to have all candidates with `age > 18`, in controller,
```
class CandidatesController < ApplicationController  
    
  def index  
    @candidate_18 = Candidate.where("age > 18")  
  end

end
```
However, if there is going to have more condition, the code will be hard to maintain. As a result, we can use scope in model:
```
class Candidate < ApplicationRecord  
    
  scope :above_18, -> { where(age > 18) }  

end
```
Then the code in controller can be rewritten as
```
class CandidatesController < ApplicationController  
    
  def index  
    @candidate_18 = Candidate.above_18  
  end

end
```

Difference between self-defined method
The key difference: if the condition of scope cannot find data, it returns all; but if the condition of self-defined method cannot find data, it returns nil. As a result, we can use Model.scope(a).scope(b).... with no worries.

default_scope
It is the default scope that all queries runs first.


The following steps: Add Migration files -> Delete migration files -> Migration

#### Add Migration files

if we want to create a new model, a corresponded migration file created. For example, let’s generate a model called Article with columns: title, content, is_online
```
$ rails g model Article title content:text is_online:boolean
```
Then in db/migrate, we can see a file, timestamp_create_articles.rb:
```
class CreateArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]  
  def change  
    create_table :articles do |t|  
      t.string :title  
      t.text :content  
      t.boolean :is_online  
        
      t.timestamps  
    end  
  end  
end
```
Ｔhe change method is to create a table with title (string), content (text), is_online (boolean) and timestamp for recording `:created_at, :updated_at`

#### Delete migration files

If you created wrong migration file, delete it with
```
$ rails d migration SameMigrationNameAsUsedToGenerate
```
Notice! please do it only before `db:migrate`

#### Migrate

Execute the migration
```
rails db:migrate
```

#### Rollback

If we want to cancel migrations; for example, we know that we want to rollback 3 steps of migrations
```
$ rails db:rollback STEP=3
```
However, the Rollback method is not recommended. We should use another migration to modify database to what we want; for example, if we want to **add a column** to an existed table, we can add another generate migration

#### add (or remove)
```
$ rails g migration add_column_to_articles
```
Then the following migration
```
class AddColumnToArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]  
  def change  
  end  
end
```
Then we can modify it
```
class AddColumnToArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]  
  def change  
    add_column :articles, :column, :string
  end
end
```
Then execute migrate
```
rails db:migrate
```
#### Schema (這應該要進一步研究)

If we want to know which migration ever be executed
```
$ rails db:migrate:status
```

#### What migration can achieve?
create_table
change_table
drop_table
add_column
change_column
rename_column
remove_column
add_index
remove_index


(1) rename a table
```
$ rails g migration change_[old_table_name]_to_[new_table_name]
```
and migration file:
```
def change
  rename_table :[old_table_name], :[new_table_name]
end
```
(2) add a column
```
$ rails generate migration add_email_to_users
```
and migration file:
```
class AddEmailToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    add_column :users, :email, :string
  end
end
```
(3) changing column
```

```
(4) dropping table
```
$ rails generate migration drop_tablename
```
and the migration file:
```
def change
  drop_table :table_name
end
```
(5) removing column
