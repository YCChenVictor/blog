## Introduction

## Why

Human pitch perception is periodic, meaning pitches in the same class having similar quality or color, octave equivalence.

## How

We can use following formula:

```bash
p = 9 + 12 * log_2(x/440)
```

to calculate the class and x is the Hz of the note. Then, A4 (x = 440), A3 (x = 220), and A2 (x = 110) have the same p = 9. It is trivial that C = 0, C# = 1, D = 2, ..., B = 11.
