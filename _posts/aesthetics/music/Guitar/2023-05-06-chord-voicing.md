## Introduction

quick explanation

## Why?

focus on why we need it

## How?

### Master Basic Chord Shapes

Start by learning essential open chords and barre chords, which will lay the foundation for understanding chord composition. Practice transitioning between different chord shapes to develop finger dexterity and familiarity with the fretboard.

### Understand Chord Theory

Study intervals, chord construction, and chord progressions to gain a deeper understanding of chord composition. This knowledge will empower you to create your own chord voicings and explore harmonic possibilities on the guitar.

* Intervals
  * Construct the chords progression with modal vamps; for example, III -> VI -> II -> V -> I progression of D dorian (Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim, C) would be Fmaj7 -> Bdim -> Em7 -> Am7 -> Dm9 and it sounds like (I need tools to records the sound)
  * Use the constructed foundation and write melodies on it
  * Document them
  * Modal vamps means chords progression such as II IV I in modes
    ```test
    C maj:
    
    C dorian:
    
    C 
    ```
    * half step matters
    * try to write songs with mode and melodies on it
    * Two ways of thinking about modes
      * derivative: D dorian is C major starting on the second degree
      * parallel: D dorina is D major with b3 and b7 (better choice)

### Analyze and Learn from Songs

Analyze songs and chord progressions from various genres to gain insights into chord composition. By studying the chords used and their functions within the progressions, you can expand your chord vocabulary and incorporate new ideas into your own compositions.
