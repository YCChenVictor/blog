## How?

Based on the idea of humanity

* Practice empathy and kindness: Being kind, empathetic, and compassionate towards others is a simple yet effective way to promote humanity, whether it's by actively listening, providing assistance, or being a source of support.
* Volunteer and donate: By volunteering or donating to a worthwhile organization, such as a local shelter, soup kitchen, or charity that aligns with your values, you can make a significant impact not only in your community but also in the larger world.
* Educate yourself: To promote humanity, it's essential to educate yourself about current global issues by reading books, watching documentaries, and exploring diverse viewpoints to gain a deeper understanding of the world.
* Speak out against injustice: To increase humanity, it's crucial to speak out against injustice by writing to officials, protesting, and defending marginalized groups when you witness inequality.
* Foster positive relationships: To promote humanity, it's important to foster positive relationships by actively listening, being supportive, showing appreciation, and having at least three to five close relationships characterized by mutual support, trust, and intimacy with family, friends, and coworkers.

## What?

### Practice Empathy and Kindness

Actually, I feel good to support my family in any kind of form. I feel good to smile at strangers. I feel good to help my colleague to solve problems and give them minor services. I think I should try to be good to those once hurt me and I will try to do it.

### Volunteer and Donate

I feel good when I do volunteering to those in need. I will go to clean the beach with volunteers and will keep doing volunteers in the future. I also feel good to donate my money to help foreign children.

### Educate Yourself

Major issues the world was facing:

* Climate Change
  * Rising global temperatures => Reduce greenhouse gas emissions => Burning of fossil fuels => Promote solar energy => Tesla
  * extreme weather conditions =>
    * greenhouse gas emissions
    * land use changes => deforestation => Brazil => agricultural expansion, soybean => We need a system to tell people what the environmental cause on each action and raise the price => But people do not have the incentive to think long-term because one day we all die => creating incentives that reward sustainable behavior => Try to record reputation incentives of companies => Try to record all carbon print of companies => The biggest emission is from coal and oil => electricity generation => solar => Permitting fees is too high => Focus on solve desert permitting fees => The evaluation of standards for photovoltaic systems cost is too high => aurora solar
  * carbon emissions (to be continued)
* COVID-19 Pandemic (to be continued)
* Economic Inequality => Wealth gap => All the actions lead to higher total economy but not all people enjoy the result => Should give people chance to work hard and join the system they want => What we can give is the information => Should build an app for medium value of salary, living cost
* Political Instability (no solution)
* Cybersecurity => Use password manager, Keep your software up to date, Be cautious of phishing emails, Use antivirus software, Use a firewall, Limit your exposure
* Disinformation: (to be continued)
* Access to Education: (to be continued)
* Natural Resource Depletion: (to be continued)
* Humanitarian Crises: (no solution)
* Demographic Change: (to be continued)
