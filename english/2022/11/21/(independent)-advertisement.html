    <p>Most advertisements make products seem much better then they really are.</p>

<hr />

<p>People often possess different perspective on whether the advertisements exaggerate the products. As for me, I strongly argue that the advertisements are fake.</p>

<p>First of all, the company cares about revenue and lying on the effects of products will help the company get at least income once. For example, when a company said that its product can clean any dirt in the world, the customers will buy this product because the company lets them feel this product is really good. On the other hand, if they did not exaggerate the properties of the product, the customers would not give this product any chance. Apparently, on the aspect of revenue, not exaggerating the effects is not a good strategy.</p>

<p>Secondly, the company cares about the cost and telling the truth will not lower the cost. For instance, when the company tries to tell the truth, it may spend a really long advertisement explaining all the advantages of this product to persuade customers to buy it. However, the company can also take really short time to tell some exaggerated truth and let potential users to evaluate this product themselves. Therefore, on the aspect of cost, the company can transfer the cost of telling the details to the potential buyers.</p>

<p>Last but not least, the company cares about eye balls. That is, the more people viewing this advertisement, the more potential customers will buy the products. Take apple watch as example, it will tell audiences that it can evaluate people’s health correctly. With common senses, we all know their applications are not doctors but the advertisement still achieve the purpose which attracts as many attractions as possible. That is, on the aspect of engagement, with exaggerated advertisements, the company can at least ensures the sources of customers.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I really think the advertisements are all fake intentionally. After all, its responsibility is to bring as many potential customers as possible.</p>
