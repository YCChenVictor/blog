## Introduction

TBC

## Purpose

Learning aesthetics allows us to develop a deeper appreciation and understanding of art, beauty, and design, enriching our perspective and enhancing our ability to create and appreciate meaningful experiences in various aspects of life.

## Concept

### Find central idea

This helps us gain clarity and focus in our thoughts and actions, enabling us to make informed decisions, set meaningful goals, and navigate through life with a sense of purpose and direction. We got to find it by our own self. My central idea is humanity.
* Practice empathy and kindness: Being kind, empathetic, and compassionate towards others is a simple yet effective way to promote humanity, whether it's by actively listening, providing assistance, or being a source of support.
* Volunteer and donate: By volunteering or donating to a worthwhile organization, such as a local shelter, soup kitchen, or charity that aligns with your values, you can make a significant impact not only in your community but also in the larger world.
* Educate yourself: To promote humanity, it's essential to educate yourself about current global issues by reading books, watching documentaries, and exploring diverse viewpoints to gain a deeper understanding of the world.
* Speak out against injustice: To increase humanity, it's crucial to speak out against injustice by writing to officials, protesting, and defending marginalized groups when you witness inequality.
* Foster positive relationships: To promote humanity, it's important to foster positive relationships by actively listening, being supportive, showing appreciation, and having at least three to five close relationships characterized by mutual support, trust, and intimacy with family, friends, and coworkers.

Major issues the world was facing:

* Climate Change

  * extreme weather conditions =>
    * greenhouse gas emissions
    * land use changes => deforestation => Brazil => agricultural expansion, soybean => We need a system to tell people what the environmental cause on each action and raise the price => But people do not have the incentive to think long-term because one day we all die => creating incentives that reward sustainable behavior => Try to record reputation incentives of companies => Try to record all carbon print of companies => The biggest emission is from coal and oil => electricity generation => solar => Permitting fees is too high => Focus on solve desert permitting fees => The evaluation of standards for photovoltaic systems cost is too high => aurora solar
  * carbon emissions (to be continued)
* COVID-19 Pandemic (to be continued)
* Economic Inequality => Wealth gap => All the actions lead to higher total economy but not all people enjoy the result => Should give people chance to work hard and join the system they want => What we can give is the information => Should build an app for medium value of salary, living cost
* Political Instability (no solution)
* Cybersecurity => Use password manager, Keep your software up to date, Be cautious of phishing emails, Use antivirus software, Use a firewall, Limit your exposure
* Disinformation: (to be continued)

### Practice art

Engaging in the practice of art can increase personal aesthetics by helping individuals develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for different forms of artistic expression. Creating art can also encourage individuals to experiment with new techniques and styles, leading to a more refined and sophisticated sense of aesthetics.

Experiment with design principles, such as color, form, and composition, in your daily life. This can help you develop a better eye for aesthetics and recognize good design.

### Explore and engage with diversity

Nature is a great source of inspiration for aesthetics. Take the time to explore natural landscapes, observe the details, and appreciate the beauty of the natural world.

Different cultures have different aesthetic values and norms. Engaging with different cultures and their art can broaden your understanding of aesthetics and help you appreciate the diversity of the world.

### Design

* User-centered design: User-centered design principles prioritize the needs, goals, and preferences of end-users, resulting in more useful, usable, and enjoyable products and services, as well as increased accessibility, inclusivity, and satisfaction for users, particularly those with disabilities or special needs.
* Sustainable design: Incorporating sustainable design principles into the design process can reduce the negative impact of products and services on the environment, improve the long-term viability of natural resources, minimize waste and pollution, and maximize efficiency, durability, and recyclability.
* Ethical design: Through ethical design principles, designers can ensure that their products and services promote social justice, fairness, and transparency by considering the ethical implications of design decisions, avoiding harm, exploitation, and discrimination, and promoting trust, respect, and accountability.
* Emotional design: Designers can enhance people's well-being, happiness, and satisfaction by creating products and services that evoke positive emotions and experiences, using emotional design principles that improve aesthetic appeal, usability, and memorability, while fostering positive brand identity and loyalty.
* Universal design: Designers can promote social inclusion, diversity, and equity by designing accessible and usable products and environments for all people, regardless of their age, gender, culture, or abilities, using universal design principles that minimize physical and social barriers, while maximizing flexibility, adaptability, and usability for all users.
