# Title

## Purpose

The study of genes serves to understand how inherited information is encoded, transmitted, and expressed in organisms, contributing to insights into various biological processes and potential applications in fields like medicine and agriculture.

## Concept

Genes are studied through various techniques such as DNA sequencing, genetic mapping, gene expression analysis, and molecular biology experiments to decipher their structure, function, and interactions within organisms.

### DNA sequencing

DNA sequencing is a technique used to determine the precise order of nucleotides (A, T, C, and G) **within a DNA molecule**.

The steps:

* Break down DNA into smaller fragments
* Add labeled nucleotides
* Reconstruct the original sequence of the DNA molecule by the label nucleotides because labeled nucleotides may overlap each other

In general, one DNA molecule composes a chromosome.

### Genetic mapping

It determines the positions of genes on **chromosomes**. It provides information about the order of genes along a chromosome, the distances between genes, and how genes are inherited together due to their physical proximity on the same chromosome. This mapping is crucial for understanding the genetic makeup of organisms and the inheritance patterns of traits and diseases.

### Gene Expression Analysis



### Basic Knowledge

#### Biology

Biology is the scientific study of life and living organisms, encompassing a vast range of topics from the molecular and cellular levels to the interactions between organisms and their environments. It seeks to understand the processes, structures, functions, and diversity of life forms, providing insights into the fundamental principles that govern life on Earth.
