### Behavior Question

#### Faria

* Give me an example of a time when you had to adapt to a change in a work environment. How did you approach it?

The most pivotal shift in my professional life occurred with the unexpected resignation of the CEO at my previous company, a figure who also happened to be the founder and had held the position for decades. Initially, concerns about potential mass layoffs loomed, causing a sense of apprehension. However, my proactive approach in resolving various issues and introducing valuable features to my product proved instrumental in solidifying my position within the organization.

As my supervisor interviewed me about this abrupt change, I found myself in a tranquil state, buoyed by confidence in the contributions I had made to the team and reassured about the stability of my role. Taking the initiative, I reassured my supervisor that I remained unaffected by the change, despite my initial shock. I emphasized my commitment to maintaining peak performance and ensuring the ongoing success of my role within the organization. This proactive stance not only alleviated any concerns my supervisor may have had but also underscored my dedication to making valuable contributions and retaining a sense of ownership amidst significant organizational changes.

Reflecting on this experience, I've gained a deeper understanding of the importance of dedication in our daily work. Life's uncertainties underscore the need for a consistent and committed approach, as we never know what challenges or opportunities may arise.

* Tell me about a situation where you had to work with a challenging client or customer. How did you handle the relationship?

In my role as a software engineer at Faria, I encountered a challenging situation while working with a particular customer. The challenge revolved around implementing cookie settings for their users visiting their page, utilizing a third-party API that imposed fees based on query volume or multiple domains.

Initially, when we communicated the necessity for the customer to apply for the required credentials due to the associated fees, they were resistant and unwilling to bear the additional cost. This posed a significant hurdle in moving forward with the implementation of the desired features.

To navigate this challenging client relationship, I adopted a proactive and transparent communication approach. I patiently explained the intricacies of the third-party API's fee structure and the reasons why they needed to take charge of obtaining the credentials. I ensured that I provided detailed information on how the fees were essential for accessing the API and, consequently, for delivering the intended cookie settings.

Despite multiple discussions, it took some time for the client to fully comprehend the situation. However, maintaining open lines of communication and emphasizing the importance of these steps for the project's success played a crucial role in building trust. I took the opportunity to showcase the potential benefits and long-term advantages of investing in the necessary credentials, assuring them that it would enhance their users' experience and contribute to the overall success of their platform.

Ultimately, through perseverance and clear communication, the client began to appreciate the need for obtaining the credentials. They acknowledged the rationale behind the decision, and this understanding paved the way for a more cooperative and collaborative working relationship. By the end of the process, not only did we successfully implement the required features, but the experience also highlighted the importance of transparency and effective communication in managing challenging client relationships.

#### Faria, Advancement module

* Can you describe a challenging project you've worked on? Advancement module
* How do you handle tight deadlines and pressure? Transparency

The most challenging one is a module we built in Faria, aiming helping schools, our customers, to manage the relationship with their graduated students. During the development, I need to understand the legacy code in short period because the new feature needs a smooth integration with the old systems. Also, this feature is a premium feature, so I need to modularize it for showing it to only those paid customers.

At first, I asked several co-workers whether they know the logics of the legacy code as there is no unit tests for these features. However, only one developer has developed a similar one with little understanding of these codebase. As a result, I started the try and error process, which literally copy paste the old codebase directly with some amendments and developed one which seemingly fitted the specifications. During the process, I keep full transparency with my manager, product managers, and QA team, resulting in their big supports. For example, the QA team helped me test whether the result achieved the requirements and whether it broke the old features. Moreover, the product manager enhanced my knowledge related to the perspectives from customers and sales team and answered all my questions about the conflicts between old programs and the new business logics. Through out the iterations, I accomplished the new system and it successfully attracts new revenue from customers. Fortunately, I only made one manageable mistake in this whole process, which require some minor amendments on the database data. After this whole process, I am the only person, having full understanding about the fields mechanism in the product, so I also added the key unit tests to keep functionalities.

In the past, I usually expected clear specifications for a new project. Nevertheless, sometime, in a competitive market, benchmarking market has higher priority. Consequently, I need to adjust my mindset to meet the expectations. To have a clear goal, communication serves as a fundamental factor. Then, keep refreshing the goals through adaptability. Then, keep transparency so that team members can help. To boost the efficiency in all aspects during this whole process, honing the coding skill persistently and decomposing the logics into smaller problems to solve step by step are the keys.

#### OneAD, SuperDSP

* Tell me about a time when you had to resolve a conflict within a team.
* Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a difficult team member. How did you handle it?

While developing this module, I encountered situations where I required information from other departments. However, my manager prefers all communication to go through her, maintaining a centralized approach to project oversight. Unfortunately, this led to a misunderstanding when one of my co-workers was perceived as attempting to handle tasks covertly. To address this, I engaged in a conversation with my co-worker, emphasizing the importance of aligning our efforts with team goals. I encouraged him to focus on the collective objectives we aimed to achieve and, during our discussion, I also checked if he was experiencing any emotional distress stemming from the miscommunication with our manager. This approach aimed at fostering a positive and collaborative work environment and ensuring that everyone is on the same page moving forward.

#### Faria, Parent UI redesign

Please check the answer in this section again

* Can you share an example of a project or task that didn't go as planned? How did you handle the situation and what did you learn from it?

When I joined the project, the UI had already undergone changes as per the new design; however, both the feature and unit tests were found to be broken. Subsequently, the development team approached the project manager to assign me the task of rectifying the issues. Upon investigation, it became apparent that some desired behaviors had deviated from the correct business logic, and the frontend developers had not strictly adhered to Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices, leading to significant delays in the overall processes.

Upon recognizing the need for a more collaborative approach, I adjusted my strategy by informing the project managers first and then engaging closely with the frontend developers to understand the challenges they were facing. This shift initiated a series of productive meetings, where we collectively addressed discrepancies between the design and implemented features, as well as tackled issues within the testing process. Together, we identified root causes, such as miscommunication, a lack of adherence to testing practices, and insufficient communication regarding changes in business requirements. Rather than placing blame on individuals, we focused on improving processes. Collaborating extensively with the frontend developers, I updated the tests to accurately reflect the correct business logic. Simultaneously, we established clearer communication channels among the design, development, and testing teams to prevent similar issues in the future.
