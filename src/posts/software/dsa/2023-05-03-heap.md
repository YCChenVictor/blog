## Introduction

TBC

## Why?

Heaps are necessary because they provide an efficient way to manage **priority-based** operations, such as retrieving the minimum or maximum element, which is valuable in various applications like scheduling, graph algorithms, and priority queues.

## How?

### Max Heap

* Definition: A max heap is a complete binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its child nodes, with the maximum value located at the root node.
* Visualization
  <div class="mermaid">
    graph TD
    B((20)) --> C((18))
    B((20)) --> D((15))
    C((18)) --> E((10))
    C((18)) --> F((12))
    D((15)) --> G((8))
    D((15)) --> H((7))
    E((10)) --> I((5))
    E((10)) --> J((6))
  </div>

### Min Heap

* Definition:
* Visualization
  <div class="mermaid">
    graph TD
    B((10)) --> C((15))
    B((10)) --> D((20))
    C((15)) --> E((18))
    C((15)) --> F((17))
    D((20)) --> G((25))
    D((20)) --> H((30))
  </div>

### Basic Structure

Although heap is a complete binary tree, we usually use array to construct heap because of efficient memory usage, sequential access, cache efficiency, simplicity of indexing, and improved space efficiency.

```javascript
class Heap {
  constructor() {
    this.heap = [];
  }

  insert(value) {
    // ... insert implementation
  }

  delete() {
    // ... delete implementation
  }

  heapify() {
    // ... heapify implementation
  }

  // ... other heap-related methods
}

```
