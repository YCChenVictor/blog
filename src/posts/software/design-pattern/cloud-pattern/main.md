# Title

## Purpose

The cloud patterns solve common problems during cloud development such as data management, design and implementation, and messaging.

## Concept

If you are using any cloud computing resources, then you are developing cloud application.

### data management

Data is hosted in different locations, so we need a pattern to synchronize them across different locations.

### design and implementation

Increase the quality of deployment, maintainability, development, reusability.

### messaging

There are different nodes in this system, so we need a good messaging mechanism for them to communicate with each other. Usually, we use asynchronous messaging to decouple producer and consumer. However, it brings other issues such as ordering messages, poison message management, idempotency.
