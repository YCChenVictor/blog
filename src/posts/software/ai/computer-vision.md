### How it recognize specific movement

Computer vision detects specific movements by analyzing changes in the positions and features of objects within a sequence of images or frames; for example, Kalman filter.

I am not trying to walk through the math. I just try to build app on them. After searching multiple platform, there seems no better than just split the video into multiple picture and use GPT-4 to detect whether there is a specific movement in these pictures, so I will try to build an image recognition with GPT-4 first.
