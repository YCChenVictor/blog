## Example

### Introduction

Hello, I am Victor. Worked as rails developer for around 3 years. Currently, I can work in Canada legally and am looking for opportunities in Canada. Specifically, I can develop apps in rails, vue, react, node.

In the past years, I participated projects in both Ad tech and Ed tech. In Ad tech, I build a system with the team for biding in the advertisement market. In Ed tech, (I should finish resume first, so that I can have clear descriptions of projects)

### Behavior Question

#### Advancement module

* Can you describe a challenging project you've worked on? Advancement module
* How do you handle tight deadlines and pressure? Transparency

The most challenging one is a module we built in Faria, aiming helping schools, our customers, to manage the relationship with their graduated students. During the development, I need to understand the legacy code in short period because the new feature needs a smooth integration with the old systems. Also, this feature is a premium feature, so I need to modularize it for showing it to only those paid customers.

At first, I asked several co-workers whether they know the logics of the legacy code as there is no unit tests for these features. However, only one developer has developed a similar one with little understanding of these codebase. As a result, I started the try and error process, which literally copy paste the old codebase directly with some amendments and developed one which seemingly fitted the specifications. During the process, I keep full transparency with my manager, product managers, and QA team, resulting in their big supports. For example, the QA team helped me test whether the result achieved the requirements and whether it broke the old features. Moreover, the product manager enhanced my knowledge related to the perspectives from customers and sales team and answered all my questions about the conflicts between old programs and the new business logics. Through out the iterations, I accomplished the new system and it successfully attracts new revenue from customers. Fortunately, I only made one manageable mistake in this whole process, which require some minor amendments on the database data. After this whole process, I am the only person, having full understanding about the fields mechanism in the product, so I also added the key unit tests to keep functionalities.

In the past, I usually expected clear specifications for a new project. Nevertheless, sometime, in a competitive market, benchmarking market has higher priority. Consequently, I need to adjust my mindset to meet the expectations. To have a clear goal, communication serves as a fundamental factor. Then, keep refreshing the goals through adaptability. Then, keep transparency so that team members can help. To boost the efficiency in all aspects during this whole process, honing the coding skill persistently and decomposing the logics into smaller problems to solve step by step are the keys.

#### SuperDSP

* Tell me about a time when you had to resolve a conflict within a team.

When I developing this module, sometimes, I need information from other departments. However, my manager does not like direct communication without her. That is, she needs to be full in charge on everything. Accordingly, one of my co-workers was misunderstood by my manager that he want to do some tasks secretly. To move forward, I talked with my co-worker and encouraged him to focus on the goals. Also, I double confirmed whether he had some emotional suffering from the blaming from our manager. (should correct this in a better order)
