## Example

### Introduction

Hello, I am Victor. Worked as rails developer for around 3 years. Currently, I can work in Canada legally and am looking for opportunities in Canada. Specifically, I can develop apps in rails, vue, react, node.

In the past years, I participated projects in both Ad tech and Ed tech. In Ad tech, I build a system with the team for biding in the advertisement market. In Ed tech, (I should finish resume first, so that I can have clear descriptions of projects)

### Behavior Question

The most challenge project is a project, aiming helping schools, our customers, to manage the relationship with their graduated students. During the development, I need to understand the legacy code in short period because the new feature needs integration with these old system. Also, this feature is a premium feature, so I need to modularize it for showing it to only those paid customers.

At first, I asked several co-workers whether they know the logics of these legacy code as there is no unit tests for these feature. However, only one developer has developed a similar one with little understanding of these codebase. As a result, I started the try and error process, which literally copy paste the old codebase directly with some amendments and developed a one which seemingly fitted the specifications. During the process, I keep full transparency with my manager, product managers, and QA team, resulting in their big supports. For example, the QA team helped me test whether the result achieved the requirements and whether it broke the old features. Moreover, the product manager enhanced my knowledge related to the perspectives from customers and sales team and answered all my questions about the conflicts between program and the new business logics. Through the iterations, I accomplished the system and it successfully attracts new revenue from customers. Fortunately, I only made one mistake in this process, which require some amendments on the database data. After this whole process, I am the only person, having full understanding about the fields mechanism in the product, so I also added the key unit tests for those keep functionalities.

In the past, I usually expected clear specifications for a new project. Nevertheless, sometime, in a competitive market, benchmarking market has higher priority, so I need to adjust my mindset and strategy to meet the expectations. To have a clear goal, communication serves as a fundamental factor. Then, refresh the goals through adaptability mindset such as all the past costs are sunk costs. Then, keep transparency so that team members can help. To boost the efficiency in all aspects during this whole process, honing the coding skill persistently and decomposing the logics into smaller problems to solve step by step are the keys.
