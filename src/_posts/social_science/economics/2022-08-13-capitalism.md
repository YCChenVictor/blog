## Introduction

This article describes my thoughts about the best system of economy.

## Why?

Many existed problems around the world and the best solution now is to build a startup to solve the problem with sustainable business model. Capitalism is the main reason why we need sustainable business model. That is, problems around the world may contradict this system, so we should focus on solving other problems instead of those we thought important such as health, poverty, inequality, ...etc.

## How?

Given the training of economics, I will decompose capitalism with micro and macro methodologies and use statistics to answer the causalities.

## What?

give an example
