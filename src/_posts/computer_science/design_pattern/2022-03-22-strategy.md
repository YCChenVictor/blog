## Introduction

Constructs multiple intefaces for variant methods in a upper class so that we can have multiple **combinations** to create multiple classes inherit from this upper class with shared methods.

## Why?

We do not want to rewrite the same methods in different lower classes.

## How?

For example, given lots of varieties of dogs, there are four dogs with different **behaviors** according to their characteristics:

1. stupid dog: walks for losing its way
2. smart dog: walks to anywhere it want
3. anxious dog: kiss their owner for stroking to feel relieved
4. calm dog: kiss their owner to express intimacy

Given the characteristics above we may have four type of dogs:

1. stupid and anxious dog: Chihuahua
2. stupid and calm dog: Bulldog
3. smart and anxious dog: Sheepdogs
4. smart and calm dog: Retriever

Given the OOP concepts, we have choices as follow:

1. create an upper class and then create four classes inherit from it
2. create an polymorhpic class with four type

Given the four characteristics map four behaviors, we need to write logics or overwrite the methods in the upper class. What if we want Chihuahua to share their kissing behavior with Sheepdogs? We need the concept of **strategy** and the UML as follow:

<div class="mermaid">
classDiagram
  Dog <|-- Chihuahua : Inherit
  Dog <|-- Bulldog : Inherit
  Dog <|-- Sheepdogs : Inherit
  Dog <|-- Retriever : Inherit

  KissBehavior <-- Dog : Compose
  WalkBehavior <-- Dog : Compose

  KissBehavior : kiss()
  WalkBehavior : walk()

  KissForStroking --|> KissBehavior : Inherit
  KissForIntimacy --|> KissBehavior : Inherit

  WalkForLost --|> WalkBehavior : Inherit
  walkToAnywhere --|> WalkBehavior : Inherit

  KissForStroking : kiss()
  KissForIntimacy : kiss()
  WalkForLost : walk()
  walkToAnywhere : walk()
</div>

## What?

```ruby
class Dog
  def initialize(walk_behavior, kiss_behavior)
  end

  def kiss
    puts kiss_behavior.kiss
  end

  def walk
    puts walk_behavior.walk
  end
end

class KissBehavior
  def kiss
    raise 'Must'
  end
end

class WalkBehavior
  def walk
    raise 'Must'
  end
end

class KissForStroking < KissBehavior
  def kiss
    puts "kiss for stroking"
  end
end

class KissForIntimacy < KissBehavior
  def kiss
    puts "kiss for intimacy"
  end
end

class WalkForLost < WalkBehavior
  def walk
    puts "walk for lost"
  end
end

class WalkToAnyWhere < WalkBehavior
  def walk
    puts "walk to any where"
  end
end
```

and create instance from these four classes

```ruby
chihuahua = Dog.new(WalkForLost.new, KissBehavior.new)
chihuahua.walk
chihuahua.kiss
```
