## Introduction

Given my thoughts about the best system (refer to 2022-08-13-best-system.md), this article describes how to decompose it into functions and try to build it.

## Why?

Try to implement the concepts in browsers.

## How?

* rails as backend
* react as frontend
* build frontend for objects to interact
* define the exchange system between these objects in backend

Note: remember to include test in these project to make sure the world not collapse

## What?

* landing page (TBC)
  * render a world without character (1993-09-01-create-world)
  * contains introduction of the system
* login page
* 3D objects
  * create characters who have physiological needs, safety needs, love and social belonging needs
* create login page

### Frontend

### Backend

To store experience in database, try to understand how brain works

To share experience in databse, meta

To make contract, blockchain
