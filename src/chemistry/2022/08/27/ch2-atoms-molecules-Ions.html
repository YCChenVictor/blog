<p>focus on why we need it</p>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<h3 id="fundamental-laws">fundamental laws</h3>

<ul>
  <li>conservation of mass: mass is neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions</li>
  <li>definite proportion
    <ul>
      <li>defination: chemical compound always contains its component elements in fixed ratio</li>
      <li>example: \(CO_2\) has one C (6) and two O (8), so in X grams of \(CO_2\), there must be X * 6/(6+8<em>2) grams of O and X * 8</em>2/(6+8*2) grams of O. The proportion of C/O must be 3/8.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>multiple proportions
    <ul>
      <li>defination: given two elements form more than one compound, the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will always be ratios of small whole numbers</li>
      <li>example: in \(CO\) and \(CO_2\), given one mass of C, the ratio of O in CO and \(CO_2\) must be \(1/2\)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="daltons-atomic-theory">Dalton’s atomic theory</h3>

<ul>
  <li>All matter is made of atoms</li>
  <li>All atoms of a given element are identical in mass and properties</li>
  <li>Chemical compounds are formed when atoms combine</li>
  <li>Atoms are not changed in chemical reactions but the way they are bound together
changes</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="early-atomic-experiments-and-models">Early atomic experiments and models</h3>

</ul>

<h3 id="atomic-structure">Atomic structure</h3>

<ul>
  <li>nucleus contains protons (positive charge) and neutrons (no charge)</li>
  <li>electrons reside outside the nucleus
    <ul>
      <li>electrons, negative charge, small mass (1/1840 of proton)</li>
      <li>the distance between electrons and nucleus is relatively large</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>isotopes have the same atomic number but different mass numbers</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bonds">bonds</h3>

<p>Atoms combine to form molecules by sharing electrons to form bonds such as iconic and covalent.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Structural formula
    <ul>
      <li>definition: demonstrates molecules with bonds and atoms on 2D</li>
      <li>example: TBC (can draw \(H_2O\) here)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ball-and-stick model
    <ul>
      <li>definition: demonstrates molecules with bonds (stick) and atoms (ball) on 3D</li>
      <li>example: TBC</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Space-filling model
    <ul>
      <li>deifiition: demonstrates molecules with overlapping spheres to show the bonds on 3D</li>
      <li>example: TBC</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ions">Ions</h3>

<p>Ion’s total number of electrons is unequal to total number of protons, meaning the new charge of it is not zero.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cation
    <ul>
      <li>formed by loss of an electron, positive charge</li>
      <li>metals</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Anion
    <ul>
      <li>formed by gain of an electron, negative charge</li>
      <li>Nonmetals</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ionic bonds: formed by interaction of cations and anions</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="compound">compound</h3>

<ul>
  <li>binary compounds: chemical compounds comprising of <strong>two</strong> distinct elements
    <ul>
      <li>binary ionic compounds, type I
        <ul>
          <li>definition: contain a positive ion (cation) and a negative ion (anion)</li>
          <li>example: NaCl</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>binary ionic compounds, type II
        <ul>
          <li>definition: more than one type of positive ion -&gt; more than one type of ionic compound</li>
          <li>example: \(FeCl_2\) and \(FeCl_3\)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>binary covalent compounds, type III
        <ul>
          <li>definition: formed between two nonmetals</li>
          <li>example: \(H_2O\)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>non binary compounds: compounds that contain <strong>more than two</strong> different elements
    <ul>
      <li>example: \(NaOH\)</li>
      <li>\(OH^-\) is a kind of polyatomic ion</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ions-vs-molecules">Ions vs molecules</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ion are compound with ionic bond and molecule are compound with covalent bond</li>
  <li>quickest way to predict the bond: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">metal + nonmetal = ionic</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nonmetal + nonmetal = covalent</code></li>
  <li>covalent bond forms by sharing electrons</li>
  <li>ionic bond forms by transfering electrons</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="molecules-vs-compound">molecules vs compound</h3>

<p>When atoms bonds together, it forms molecule. When two different atoms bonds together, it forms compound; actually, compound is a kind of molecules but the atoms must be different. For example, \(H_2O\) is both molecule and compound but \(O_2\) is only molecule.</p>

<p>Binary compounds
• Type I—contain a metal that always forms the same cation
• Type II—contain a metal that can form more than one cation • Type III—contain two nonmetals
􏳂 Compounds containing a polyatomic ion</p>

<h3 id="periodic-table">periodic table</h3>

<ul>
  <li>periodic table organizes elements in order of increasing atomic number
    <ul>
      <li>atomic number: the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>elements with similar properties are in columns, or groups
    <ul>
      <li>because the arrangement of electrons in outermost layer are the same</li>
      <li>example: O is \(1s^22s^22p^4\), S is \(1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^4\), and Se is \(3d^{10}4s^24p^4\)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
