<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The structure of this article:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Thread</strong>: the smallest unit of program for CPU to execute.</li>
  <li><strong>Concurrency</strong>: lets CPU perform multiple threads at the same time.</li>
  <li><strong>Process</strong>: the program that has been loaded into memory along with registers (how to execute this process) and a program counter (what’s the next process)
    <ul>
      <li>register may hold an instruction, a storage address, or other kind of data needed by the process (refer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpnE6UAfbtU">here</a>)</li>
      <li>program counter (instruction pointer), a special type of register, storing the address of the instruction to be executed next</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The flow:</p>

  id3(memory) --decompose--&gt; id4(process 1)

  id4(process 1) --decompose--&gt; id8(thread 2)
  id4(process 1) --...decompose--&gt; id9(...other threads)

</div>

<ul>
  <li>threads share memory in the same process</li>
  <li>processes take their own part of memory and cannot share memory with other process</li>
  <li>communication between threads is faster than processes</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Concurrency decreases waiting time and response time and increase resource utilization and efficiency.</p>
