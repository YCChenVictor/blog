<p>Aesthetic experiences include listening to music in any place, stickers on my laptop, feelings when looking at sunset, savoring the first bite of meal, emotionally investing in the characters in movie or noval.</p>

<p>Aesthetic was invented by Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten. He defined what a good art is by studying good and bad taste, linking good taste with beauty.</p>

<p>Art imitates the objects and events of ordinary life. - Plato</p>

<p>The aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance. - Aristotle</p>
