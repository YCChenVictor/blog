    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This article describes my thoughts about the best system of economy.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>I doubt whether capitalism is the best system.</p>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<p>In the past, we focus on achieving the biggest welfare, which leads to the conclusion of capitalism. Today, I promote a new concept, willingness of joining the system.</p>

<p>To answer the willingness, let us understand the foundation of a human being. The best system should offer all human beings the opportunity to think about why living on the world, so it should offer environment letting human think why</p>

<ul>
  <li>physiological needs</li>
  <li>safety needs</li>
  <li>love and social belonging needs</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-tbc">What? (TBC)</h2>

<p>This system should let human beings have incentives to pursue physiological needs, safety needs, and love and social belonging needs so that they can start asking why to live afterwards.</p>

<p>When a human arrives to this world, we should give this person adequate food, water, home, friends, family, …etc. However, if the amount is too much, then this person will not suffer and start to think why living, so the pre-defined amount should be gonverned.</p>

<p>There may be an issue: a human defines the why as giving birth to someone, so these people will focus on their children, causing three problems: parents do not think their own why, children suffer from fulfilling parents’ will and parents will not let governments to govern the amount of resources. We cannot just remove the family concept because it is the basic demand but can encourage human beings to join this system by letting their children to have more opportunities to understand the why with the experience sharing by other people in this system.</p>

<p>Information asymmetry may trigger free rider issue because human beings can simply acquire the information from this system but not contributing to share experience with other people. The best way to solve it is a mechanism to store any information this person walked through and every people who are still finding their own why can browse it or even experience it personally.</p>

<p>To achieve it, we need a huge database to store the experience and meta universe like technology for human to experience it. The incentive for people to share their life experience can be defined by themselves with blockchain technology, the more people learned from their experience to decide their future why, the more awards they get based on their smart contracts with this system and they can use the awards to exchange all the substances in this system.</p>
