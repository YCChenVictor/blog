        Hello and welcome to my personal blog! Have fun and have a good day!
        I was born and raised in Taiwan, and I've always had a passion for <a href='{{site.baseurl}}/self/2023/02/04/software.html'>software</a>.
        You can explore more in <a href='{{site.baseurl}}/explore' class="text-gray-200 hover:text-black px-0.5 py-0.5 lg:py-1 mx-auto">here</a>.
        I graduated from National Taiwan University with a degree in economics, and I am now working as a software engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, you can usually find me developing websites, composing music, painting, and working out, or spending time with my family and pet. I also love to explore new topics and ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this blog, I aim to share my unique perspective on a wide range of topics, with a primary focus on the software field at present. I firmly believe in the power of knowledge and innovation to propel humanity forward, and I am dedicated to living my life in alignment with these values.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better, and I look forward to connecting with you through this blog!
