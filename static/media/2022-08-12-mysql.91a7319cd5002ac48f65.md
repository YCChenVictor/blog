## Introduction

MySQL is a kind of SQL language for data manipulation in relational database.

## Why?

Learning MySQL is valuable because it equips you with the essential skills to efficiently manage and manipulate relational databases, empowering you to handle data effectively in a wide range of applications and industries.

## How?

* Init
  * Install: `brew install mysql`
  * Start: `brew services start mysql`
  * Open console: `mysql -u root -p` and then enter password
* Database
  * Create: `CREATE DATABASE desired_database_name`
  * Read
    * Databases: `SHOW DATABASES;`
    * Specific database: `USE database_name;`
  * Update
    * rename database
    * first approach (details below): create a new database -> move tables to new database -> remove the old database
    * second approach (details below): export and import with mysqldump
  * Destroy: `drop database <db_name>;`
* Table
  * Create: `CREATE TABLE desired_table_name ...`
    * Example:
      ```bash
      CREATE TABLE users(id INT(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100), email VARCHAR(100), username VARCHAR(30), password VARCHAR(100), register_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
      ```
  * Read: `SHOW TABLES;`
  * Update
    * rename table: `RENAME TABLE tb1 TO tb2;`
    * transfer table: `CREATE TABLE destination_db.my_table SELECT * FROM source_db.my_table;`
  * Destroy: `DROP TABLE "TABLE_NAME";`
* Row
  * Create: `INSERT INTO table_name(attributes...) VALUES(values...)`
  * Read
    * All rows: `SELECT * FROM table_name;`
  * Update
  * Destroy: `DELETE FROM ‘table_name’ WHERE id = 1 LIMIT 1`
* Data type
  * Integer types
    * INTEGER
    * INT
    * SMALLINT
    * TINYINT
    * MEDIUMINT
    * BIGINT
  * String types
    * VARCHAR(255): Each cell in this column can include up to 255 characters
  * Number types
    * DECIMAL(M, D)
      * `M` means maximum number of digits (the precision) and has range from 1 to 65
      * `D` means number of digits to the right of the decimal point (the scale) and has a range of 0 to 30 and must be no larger than `M`
  * Time related
    * DATE: reveal data in format, `'YYYY-MM-DD'` and range from `'1000-01-01'` to `'9999-12-31'`
    * DATETIME: reveal data in format, `'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'` and range from `'1000-01-01 00:00:00'` to `'9999-12-31 23:59:59'`
    * TIMESTAMP: reveal data in format, `'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'` and range of `'1970-01-01 00:00:01'` UTC to `'2038-01-19 03:14:07'` UTC
  * PRIMARY KEY: unique and not empty numberings to identify each record in a table
  * NOT NULL: No empty value in this column
* relations
  * create (detail below): `FOREIGN KEY ... REFERENCES ...`
* settings
  * table: `DESCRIBE users;`

## What?

Going to add example of blog

### insert csv

* Create table with same column names of csv file
  ```bash
  CREATE TABLE Nikkei_225 (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Date DATE NOT NULL, 
    Open DECIMAL(19, 4),
    High DECIMAL(19, 4),
    Low DECIMAL(19, 4),
    Close DECIMAL(19, 4), 
    Adj_Close DECIMAL(19, 4),
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
  );
  ```
* Load csv data
  ```bash
  LOAD DATA INFILE '/private/tmp/C.csv'
    INTO TABLE Nikkei_225
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    ENCLOSED BY '"'
    LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
    IGNORE 1 ROWS;
  ```
  * `FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','` means the method to separate each data in a row is by `,`
  * `ENCLOSED BY '"'` means each data is warped by `"`
  * `LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'` means the separating method between each line is \n, the regular expression representing change line
  * `IGNORE 1 ROWS` means the process during import csv file will ignore the column names whose location is on first row
