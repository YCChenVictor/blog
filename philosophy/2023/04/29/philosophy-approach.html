<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Aesthetics in philosophy is needed because it explores the nature of beauty and art, and helps us to better understand the role of aesthetic experiences in our lives and their significance for human culture and society.</p>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<p>My reasoning with philosophers</p>

<h3 id="immanuel-kant">Immanuel Kant</h3>

<p>From <a href="/blog/philosophy/2023/04/29/immanuel-kant.html">Immanuel Kant</a>, I know process during creation is aesthetics. So whether there is a correct way during the process? =&gt; Let’s proceed to Arthur Schopenhauer</p>

<h3 id="arthur-schopenhauer">Arthur Schopenhauer</h3>

<ul>
  <li>19th century German philosopher</li>
  <li>pessimistic views on human existence and the importance of individual experience and subjectivity.</li>
  <li>“The World as Will and Representation,” (1818)
    <ul>
      <li>Will is the underlying, unconscious force that drives all life</li>
      <li>Representation is the world as it appears to us through our senses</li>
      <li>Will is the source of all human suffering and desire, and the only way to escape this suffering is to deny the will through the practice of asceticism or the contemplation of aesthetic experience. He argues that art and beauty offer a temporary escape from the suffering of the will, allowing us to experience a moment of transcendence and detachment from the world</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(Me) Ok, so it seems aesthetics helps people escape suffering and the process of creating object should try our best to think how to transport the viewer beyond the limitations of individual existence and connect them with a deeper, universal reality. In this way, the creator’s choices in form, color, and texture are aimed at evoking a sense of transcendence and beauty in others, and helping them to escape from the suffering of the will. So which one can help the most? =&gt; According to WHO, the biggest suffering now is Mental health issues such as Depression, anxiety, stress =&gt; What’s the causes of these sufferings? =&gt; Please refer to next section</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="causes-of-mental-illness">Causes of mental illness</h3>

<p>On the point of</p>

<ul>
  <li>Existentialist philosophers
    <ul>
      <li>Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Heidegger</li>
      <li>Mental health issues can be caused by a sense of meaninglessness or purposelessness in life</li>
      <li>Human beings are fundamentally free, but that this freedom can be overwhelming and lead to feelings of anxiety and despair</li>
      <li>Depression and other mental health issues can arise when individuals feel cut off from their own sense of purpose and creativity</li>
      <li>Solution: Take responsibility for own choices and actions, embrace own freedom, create their own meaning in life, rather than relying on external sources of meaning or authority</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Psychoanalytic theorists
    <ul>
      <li>Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan</li>
      <li>Mental health issues can be caused by unconscious conflicts and repressed emotions. According to this view, individuals may be struggling with unresolved traumas or unresolved feelings, which can lead to symptoms such as anxiety or depression</li>
      <li>Solution: Psychoanalysis, a form of talk therapy that aims to explore and resolve unconscious conflicts and unresolved psychological issues that contribute to mental health issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Social and critical theorists
    <ul>
      <li>Michel Foucault</li>
      <li>Mental illness is not simply an individual problem, but is also shaped by broader social and political forces. According to Foucault, mental illness is often the result of a complex interplay between power, knowledge, and social norms</li>
      <li>Solution: Address and challenge broader social structures, rather than solely focusing on individual-level interventions. This can involve advocating for policy changes that address social inequality, challenging cultural norms and values that contribute to mental health issues, and creating more supportive and inclusive communities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(Me) Is there a standard to evaluate these three factors? =&gt; biopsychosocial model (next section)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="biopsychosocial-model">Biopsychosocial Model</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Understanding the biological basis of aesthetics: By examining the neurological processes involved in aesthetic experiences, researchers can gain insights into how our brains respond to different forms of art and beauty. For example, studies have shown that certain areas of the brain, such as the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala, are involved in our emotional responses to art.</li>
  <li>Examining the psychological factors that influence aesthetic preferences: By studying the role of personality traits, emotional states, and cognitive processes in aesthetic judgments, researchers can gain a better understanding of why people have different aesthetic preferences. For example, studies have shown that people who score high in the personality trait of openness to experience tend to have more varied and eclectic aesthetic tastes.</li>
  <li>Considering the social and cultural factors that shape aesthetic preferences: By examining the role of cultural background, social norms, and peer influences in shaping aesthetic preferences, researchers can gain insights into how these factors contribute to the diversity of aesthetic experiences across different societies and cultures.</li>
  <li>(Me) Now I know there are certain reasons these factors connects to aesthetics. But right before human-beings, the universe is there. How to define the aesthetics of universe? =&gt; Objective aspects, all the universal rules, no subjective aspects at all =&gt; Now the design fitting aesthetics well with two meanings:
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce the chaos people produced themselves =&gt; Why people create own chaos?
        <ul>
          <li>Existentialism: Creating one’s own chaos can be seen as a way of asserting one’s freedom and individuality. Existentialists believe that humans are fundamentally free, and that we must create our own meaning in life. For some, creating chaos can be a way of asserting their freedom and creating a sense of meaning or purpose in their lives.</li>
          <li>Stoicism: Creating chaos could be seen as a failure to cultivate inner calm and rationality. Stoics believe that we should focus on what we can control, and that our emotions should not be ruled by external events. Creating chaos could be seen as a failure to maintain this inner calm, and a failure to focus on what is truly important.</li>
          <li>Buddhism: Creating chaos could be seen as a manifestation of the ego, which seeks to create a sense of self-importance and identity. Buddhism teaches that suffering is caused by attachment to the ego and the external world, and that true happiness comes from letting go of these attachments. Creating chaos could be seen as a manifestation of attachment to the ego and the external world, rather than a focus on inner peace and well-being.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Follow the universal rules as many as possible =&gt; Why people cannot follow universal rules?
        <ul>
          <li>Ethics: People may prioritize their own interests over the interests of others, or that they may have conflicting moral obligations.</li>
          <li>Social and Political Philosophy: People may not follow rules if they do not believe that they have agreed to them.</li>
          <li>Epistemology: Due to limitations in their knowledge or understanding.</li>
          <li>Existentialism: Because of their individualistic and subjective nature.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>(Me) Now I know the practical solutions: Incentivizing following universal rules and Discouraging creating chaos. But both of these solutions can trigger side effects according to other philosophies. As a result, the only way is to combine both =&gt; Promoting positive social norms</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="promoting-positive-social-norms">Promoting Positive Social Norms</h3>

<p>My definition of positive social norms is people should try their best to extend human society because if something cause problems, something will be eliminate eventually, meaning I should try to increase humanity.</p>

<h2 id="what">What?</h2>

<h3 id="design-principle">Design Principle</h3>

<ul>
  <li>breadth (region)
    <ul>
      <li>Adaptability: Designs should be adaptable to changing environmental conditions.</li>
      <li>Resilience: Designs should be resilient to environmental hazards such as floods, storms, and earthquakes. This might involve designing structures that can withstand high winds or flooding, or developing systems that can continue to operate in the event of power outages or other disruptions.</li>
      <li>Resource efficiency: Designs should be resource-efficient and minimize waste. This might include designing structures that use renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power, or developing systems that conserve water and other resources.</li>
      <li>Mobility: Designs should promote mobility and enable people to move between regions or environments. This might include developing new transportation systems or designing structures that can be easily relocated.</li>
      <li>Connectivity: Designs should promote connectivity and enable people to communicate and collaborate across regions or environments. This might include developing new communication technologies or designing structures that facilitate social interaction and community building.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>depth (time)
    <ul>
      <li>Sustainable and regenerative design: This involves designing systems and structures that minimize waste, reduce energy consumption, and use renewable resources wherever possible. It also involves designing for biodiversity, ecosystem services, and regenerative practices.</li>
      <li>Resilient infrastructure: This involves designing infrastructure that is resilient to natural disasters and other disruptions, and that can adapt to changing conditions and challenges over time. It also involves designing for redundancies, flexibility, and redundancy.</li>
      <li>Social and economic equity: This involves designing social and economic systems that are equitable and inclusive, and that promote access to basic needs such as food, shelter, education, and healthcare. It also involves designing for diversity, inclusion, and accessibility.</li>
      <li>Technological innovation: This involves designing and developing new technologies that can address current and future challenges facing human society, such as climate change, resource depletion, and environmental degradation.</li>
      <li>Participatory design: This involves involving diverse stakeholders and communities in the design process, and ensuring that their needs and perspectives are considered and incorporated into the design of systems and structures.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
