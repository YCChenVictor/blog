<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<p>His philosophy is often characterized as a synthesis of rationalism and empiricism. He believed that all human knowledge is based on experience, but argued that our experience is shaped by our mental faculties, which are themselves governed by certain universal and necessary principles</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Critique of Pure Reason” (1781)
    <ul>
      <li>There are certain categories of thought, such as time, space, and causality, that are necessary for us to make sense of our experience of the world</li>
      <li>He distinguished between the “phenomenal” world of appearances, which is accessible to our senses, and the “noumenal” world of things-in-themselves, which is beyond our knowledge.
        <ul>
          <li>“Noumenal” is a term used by Kant to refer to the things-in-themselves, or the objects of our experience that are beyond the realm of appearances. According to Kant, the noumenal world is the ultimate reality that exists independently of our perception of it.</li>
          <li>Kant believed that our experience of the world is shaped by our mental faculties, which impose certain necessary and universal categories on our perceptions. These categories, such as time, space, and causality, enable us to make sense of our experience of the world, but they also limit what we can know about the world. Because the noumenal world lies beyond the limits of our understanding, it is inaccessible to us.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>“Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals” (1785)
    <ul>
      <li>Kant argued that moral principles are not based on consequences or the particular circumstances of a situation, but are rather grounded in reason itself. He believed that there are certain universal and necessary moral principles, such as the principle of respect for persons, that apply to all rational beings.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>“Critique of Judgment” (1790)
    <ul>
      <li>Aesthetic judgments are based on the subjective experience of pleasure or displeasure in response to an object.</li>
      <li>Also, He argued that there are certain objective criteria that make an object beautiful, such as qualities like harmony, proportion, and unity. Kant believed that aesthetic judgments are universal in the sense.</li>
      <li>The experience of beauty is not limited to a select few individuals. Rather, anyone who has the capacity to experience pleasure can make an aesthetic judgment about an object, whether they are an expert in the field of art or not.</li>
      <li>Disinterestedness: In making an aesthetic judgment, we are not concerned with whether the object will be useful to us or serve a particular purpose. Rather, we are interested in the object purely for its own sake, and we take pleasure in contemplating its beauty.</li>
      <li>He also recognized that many works of art have some kind of purpose, such as religious or political art, and that this purpose does not necessarily detract from their status as art. A solution can still be considered art if it is created with the intention of providing an aesthetic experience and is able to elicit a disinterested pleasure in the viewer.
        <ul>
          <li>The idea that not just the solution, but also the process, is aesthetic.
            <ul>
              <li>In architecture, the design process itself can be seen as an aesthetic experience, as architects make creative choices about form, function, and materials in order to create beautiful and functional buildings.</li>
              <li>In product design, the process of creating a product can be seen as an aesthetic experience, as designers make choices about the form, color, and texture of the product in order to create a pleasing and functional design.</li>
              <li>In creative arts, such as painting or sculpture, the creative process itself can be seen as an aesthetic experience, as artists make choices about composition, color, and form in order to create works that are beautiful and meaningful.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
