<p>I think pareto efficiency has the adequate explanation for economics efficiency and I am going to use it to explore opportunities.</p>

<p>An economy achieves pareto efficiency if all the stakeholders has no means to feel better without hurting someone. For example, in the supply side, there is no way to reallocate resources to increase two prodction at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>I believe technology can bring more welfare to everyone in the world and the opportunity lies on the space of efficiency produced by advance in technologies.</p>

<h2 id="how">How</h2>

<p>The analysis steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>decompose market into demand side and supply side</li>
  <li>In the demand side, if a technology increases a consumer’s satisfaction or lower a consumer’s cost to gain the same satifaction, then it works.</li>
  <li>In the supply side, if a technology decrease the cost of production or increase a company’s revenue, then it works.</li>
  <li>Please focus on how to help “one” consumer or “one” company and then think whether it could be a big market.</li>
</ol>
