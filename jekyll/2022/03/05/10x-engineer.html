<p>This article presents my notes towards the concept.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>I need a guide for myself to decide which tickets should I do first as a software engineer.</p>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<h3 id="defination">defination</h3>

<p>On the perspective of your organization, this engineer is 10x better than other enginners and since I am now in a company, the defination is making 10x more to benefit shareholders -&gt; increase 10x discounted cash flow (customers * (LTV - CAC) of each customer) -&gt; increase 10x customers, increase 10x LTV of each customer and decrease 10x CAC of each customer</p>

<h3 id="increase-customers">increase customers</h3>

<p>In the perspective of engineers, if this task is related to a new feature or new product, then you should do it first, given the company has already decided to do it.</p>

<h3 id="increase-ltv">increase LTV</h3>

<p>LTV = average monthly amount expected from each customer / churn rate</p>

<p>So if this ticket can increase customers’ willings to pay and decrease the amount of customers leaving, then you should do it, meaning if it’s a bug or user experience is terrible, then you should do it.</p>

<h3 id="decrease-cac">decrease CAC</h3>

<p>CAC = total cost of sales &amp; marketing / number of customers acquired</p>

<p>So if this ticket can increase the number of customers acquired given the budget, then you should do it, meaning if it attracts more users, then do it.</p>

<h3 id="summary">summary</h3>

<p>Any tickets unrelated to the above three aspects can be postponed.</p>

<p>It depends on the stage of the product to decide which aspect should be done first; for a startup product, the most important tickets related to increase customers, for a product having stable business model, meaning it’s hard to acquire more customers, the most important tickets would be related to LTV, and for a dying product, the most important tickets would be related to CAC.</p>

<h2 id="what">What?</h2>

<p>For my current company as an example, the priority would be as follow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>tickets related to new products (to expend markets) and do not care about whether it lives or not</li>
  <li>tickets related to bug and user experience of stable but not dying products</li>
  <li>tickets related to cost issue because it must related to some dying products, so we care about cost</li>
  <li>other</li>
</ol>

<p>If there are so many tickets and you do not know what to do, check this post first.</p>
