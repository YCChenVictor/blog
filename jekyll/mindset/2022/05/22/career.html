<p>Advice: Personal referral is much better. At work, establish strong relationship with managers and teammates. When employees leave, keep in touch with them.</p>

<p>I will try my best at work and try to help colleagues but I prefer letting others to notice me without efforts. That is, I will try my best to get things done and try to build meaningful project and contributions to the world. I know this approach takes longer but more real.</p>
