<p>It helps to build database as correct and quick as possible and fit the demand of user, apps, business.</p>

<ol>
  <li>It provides a preview of how all your tables should connect and what filed are going to be on each table.</li>
  <li>It helps to describe entities, attributes, relationships</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how">How?</h3>

<p>To help explaining the logics of database. Three basic concepts: entities, attributes, relationships.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Entity:</strong> Anything in real world</li>
</ol>

<p>&gt; weak entity means anything existing because an entity exists; for example, a car belongs to CEO in a company. If the CEO leaves a company, then this CEO car should also be eliminate from database.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Relation:</strong> define the relationship between entities</p>

<p>3. <strong>Attribute:</strong> the characteristic of entity</p>

<p>4. <strong>Cardinality:</strong> define the type of relationship: One-to-One, One-to-Many, May to One, Many-to-Many</p>

<h3 id="what">What?</h3>

<p>There are five steps:</p>

<p>With following example:</p>

<p>In a market, there are a lot of people, both buyers and sellers, sellers has a lots of goods and buyers use money to buy them. Of course, the buyer can also sell what they bought. Then, the design should be as follow:</p>

<h4 id="step2-define-relationship"><strong>Step2: Define Relationship</strong></h4>

<h4 id="step3-cardinality"><strong>Step3: Cardinality</strong></h4>

<p>This market stipulates each seller can only sell a goods and buyers can buy many goods.</p>
