<p>ORM (object relational mapping) lets programs query and manipulate data from database with object-oriented paradigm.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>DRY, easier to maintain with the structure of model</li>
  <li>Miscellaneous task such as database connection can bed done automatically</li>
  <li>MVC structure enforced, making cleaner code structure</li>
  <li>No more SQL needed, making consistent coding style</li>
  <li>Abstract database system, so you can change it all the time</li>
  <li>OOP structure (hard to implement it to plain SQL)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>OOP &amp; DRY (to be continued)</li>
  <li>reduce miscellaneous tasks (to be continued)</li>
  <li>MVC structure (to be continued)</li>
  <li>Abstract database: ORM uses Doctrine Database Abstraction Layer to serve as translator between database and programs</li>
</ul>
