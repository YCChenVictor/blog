## Introduction

This article records how to practice guitar in only one string and the theory behind it.

## Why

To fully understand the feeling of each string.

## How

1. construct the chords progression with modal vamps; for example, III -> VI -> II -> V -> I progression of D dorian (Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim, C) would be Fmaj7 -> Bdim -> Em7 -> Am7 -> Dm9 and it sounds like (I need tools to records the sound)

I need tools to records the sound (stuck)

skip (going to fill it)

2. use the constructed foundation and write melodies on it
3. document them

I need ways to document them, so I need more knowledge about music theory

## What

Modal vamps means chords progression such as II IV I in modes

```test
C maj:

C dorian:

C 
```

half step matters

try to write songs with mode and melodies on it

Two ways of thinking about modes:

1. derivative: D dorian is C major starting on the second degree
2. parallel: D dorina is D major with b3 and b7 (better choice)
