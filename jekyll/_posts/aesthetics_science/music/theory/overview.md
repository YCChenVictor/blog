# overview

## Introduction

Three sections:

1. rudiments (key signatures, time signatures, and rhythmic notation)
2. scholars' views from antiquity to the present
3. musicology, defining processes and general principles in music

## Why

I want to write songs based on theories, gaining more possibilities.

## How

### rudiments

#### key signatures

Key signature is a collection of every "sharp" or "flat" signs in a scale on the right-hand side of clefs.

Take D flat major scale as example,

:::abc
M:4/4
L:1/8
K:Db
|C2D2E2F2|G2A2B2c2|
:::

There are five "flat" signatures besides clef and the order of the signatures are "B E A D G". The order of these flat signs could be the first letter in the wordings of this sentence: "Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles' Father".

And take E major as example,

:::abc
M:4/4
L:1/8
K:E
|C2D2E2F2|G2A2B2c2|
:::

As you can see, there are four sharp signitures and the order of these sharp signs could be the first letter in the wording of this sentence: "Father Charles Goes Down And Ends Battle"

Several topics to explore:

1. staff
2. clef
3. diatonic keys
4. circle of fifths
5. modal folk tunes
6. middle C

#### time signatures

Vertical lines seperate the measures. Two measures as follow:

:::abc
|xxxx|xxxx|
:::

4/4 means there are four quarter notes in a measure as follow

:::abc
|B2 B2 B2 B2|
:::

#### rhythmic notation

whole

:::abc
M:4/4
|B8|
:::

half

:::abc
M:4/4
|B4B4|
:::

quarter

:::abc
M:4/4
|B2B2B2B2|
:::

eighth

:::abc
M:4/4
|B1B1B1B1 B1B1B1B1|
:::

sixteenth

:::abc
M:4/4
|B1/2B1/2B1/2B1/2 B1/2B1/2B1/2B1/2 B1/2B1/2B1/2B1/2 B1/2B1/2B1/2B1/2|
:::

thirty-second

:::abc
M:4/4
|B1/4B1/4B1/4B1/4 B1/4B1/4B1/4B1/4 B1/4B1/4B1/4B1/4 B1/4B1/4B1/4B1/4 B1/4B1/4B1/4B1/4 B1/4B1/4B1/4B1/4 B1/4B1/4B1/4B1/4 B1/4B1/4B1/4B1/4|
