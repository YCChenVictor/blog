## Introduction

This pattern

* makes my code prettier just like facade increase the taste of my house even thought my house is messy
* belongs to structural patterns, so it structures a specific kind of objects
* deal with **complex** set of objects, which these objects did not follow any particular structure; they should be **messy**

<div id='facade' class='h-screen justify-center items-center'>
  <div id='facade_toggle_erase' class=''></div>
  <div id='facade_image_save' class=''></div>
  <div id='facade_canvas' class='border'></div>
</div>

<script>
  const id = 'facade'
  let binarySearchTree = p5Draw(id)
  let binarySearchTreeP5 = new p5(binarySearchTree, id);
</script>

## Why?

We only care about the aspects we care; for example, given a delivery system, user cares **when** the package arrives and the **cost**.

Even thought the process of delivering involves shippings, air transport, ...etc and it is truly complicate, we do not care. We should prepare the system to have clean interfaces (facades) for them to acquire the information they want.

## How? & What?

For example, there are multiple services:

* service for transportation: `OceanShippingService`, `AirTransportationService`, `LandTransportationService`
* service to evaluate whether this item is deliverable: `Package`
* service to return possible routes: `Route`

Actually we only care the possible choices of time and cost, so

```ruby
WhatWeCare.new('Taichung', 'Taipei', 'Chihuahua').result
## example result: (when it arrives, cost)
[
  ['60 mins', 1000],
  ['30 mins', 2000],
]
```

`WhatWeCare` is a facade as follow: (pseudocode)

```ruby
class WhatWeCare # facade
  def initialize(origin, destination, item)
    @origin = origin
    @destination = destination
    @item = item
  end

  def result
    Route.new(@origin, @destination).results.map do |route|
      if route.is_deliverable?
        [
          when_it_arrives(route),
          cost(route)
        ]
      end
    end
  end

  private
  def when_it_arrives(route)
    result = []
    route.each do |sub_route|
      case sub_route.type
      when 'Air'
        AirTransportationService.new(sub_route).time
      when 'Land'
        LandTransportationService.new(sub_route).time
      when 'Ocean'
        OceanTransportationService.new(sub_route).time
      end
    end
    result.sum
  end

  def cost(route)
    result = []
    route.each do |sub_route|
      case sub_route.type
      when 'Air'
        AirTransportationService.new(sub_route).cost
      when 'Land'
        LandTransportationService.new(sub_route).cost
      when 'Ocean'
        OceanTransportationService.new(sub_route).cost
      end
    end
    result.sum
  end

  def routes(@origin, @destination)
    Route.new(@origin, @destination)
  end
end
```

given the service as follow:

```ruby
class Route
  # returns all possible routes
  def initialize(origin, destination)
    ...
  end

  def results # suppose there are two possible routes
    ...
    possible_routes.map do |route|
      if is_deliverable?(route)
        route
      end
    end
  end

  private
  def possible_routes
    ...
    [
      ['Taichung to Taoyuan (Air)', 'Taoyuan to Taipei (Ocean)'],
      ['Taichung to Hsinchu (Air)', 'Hsinchu to Banqiao (Ocean)', 'Banqiao to Taipei (Ocean)'],
      ...
    ]
  end

  def is_deliverable?(route)
    Package(route).result
  end
end

class Package
  # returns whether this package is deliverable in this route
  def initialize(route)
    ...
  end

  def result
    ...
    true or false # whether the item is deliverable in this sub-route
  end
end

class OceanShippingService
  # returns the estimates of delivery time and cost
  def initialize(route)
    ...
  end

  def time
    ...
  end

  def cost
    ...
  end
end

class AirTransportationService
  # returns the estimates of delivery time and cost
  def initialize
    ...
  end

  def time
    ...
  end

  def cost
    ...
  end
end

class LandTransportationService
  # returns the estimates of delivery time and cost
  def initialize
    ...
  end

  def time
    ...
  end

  def cost
    ...
  end
end
```
