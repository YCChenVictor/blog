## Introduction

I am going to demonstrate the OOP concepts with ruby.

1. classes: object-oriented style to create objects with these classes
2. coupling & cohesion: in OOP, we want low coupling and high cohesion, having a more independent object
3. abstraction:
4. encapsulation:
5. interfaces:
6. inheritnace:
7. polymorphism: treating an object as a generic version of something; for example, car, truck, and bicycle are versions of vehicle.
8. Unified Modeling Language (UML):

## Why

Because we can have deeper understanding in morden software design.

## How & What

### classes

We use class to create objects and the class will define the attributes and methods these objects have. For example, a `User` class in any SaaS product would be as follow:

```ruby
class User
  def initialize(name)
    # attributes
    @name = name
  end
  
  # methods
  def say_hello
    puts "Hello, my name is " + @name
  end
end

user = User.new('name')
user.say_hello
user.name
```

### coupling & cohesion

We want less coupling and high cohesion

#### concept

If this class is a machine in a company, we want it to be as independent as possible so that once it needs to be replace or suspended for some reason, we can easily do it, increasing the maintainability of this company.

So anything making this machine to be related to other components of this company will increase coupling.

#### math

$$Coupling(C) = 1 - 1/(d_o + d_i + 2 * (c_o + c_i) + g_d + 2 * g_c + w + r)$$

1. $$d_o$$ = number of output data parameters
2. $$d_i$$ = number of input data parameters
3. $$c_o$$ = number of output control parameters
4. $$c_i$$ = number of input control parameters
5. $$g_d$$ = number of global variables used as data
6. $$g_c$$ = number of global variables used as control
7. $$w$$ = number of modules called (fan-out)
8. $$r$$ = number of modules calling the module under consideration (fan-in)

#### how to decrease coupling

skip (to be continued)

### Abstraction

Abstraction shows only **essential** attributes; for example, in this world, there are lots of animals such as human, pig, ...etc and there are some identical characteristics, then we can first define a class, `Animal` and then subdivide it with inheritance rather than writing both classes having the same characteristics.

```ruby
class Animal
  def initialize
  end

  def eat
  end
end

class Human < Animal
  def speak
  end
end

class Pig
end
```

rather than

```ruby
class Human < Animal
  def initialize
  end

  def eat
  end

  def speak
  end
end

class Pig
  def initialize
  end

  def eat
  end
end
```

### Encapsulation

The private methods are example of encapsulation in ruby. You cannot use the methods outside the class. We only show the meaningful methods for outsiders.

### Interfaces

An interface implements abstraction and encapsulation throughly, making we only see the appearance of this function and use it easily; for example, we know the light can be on by switching the button but we do not know the logics behind it.

### Inheritance

For example, I want to create Animals: Dog, Cat, Bird.

```ruby
class Animal
  def initialize
  end

  def move
    puts "#{self.class.name} is moving"
  end
end

class Dog < Animal
end

class Cat < Animal
end

class Bird < Animal
end

dog = Dog.new
cat = Cat.new
bird = Bird.new

dog.move
cat.move
bird.move
```

### Polymorphism

For example, I want to create Animals: Dog, Cat, Bird I can write a polymorphic class as follow:

```ruby
class Animal
  DOG = 0
  CAT = 1
  BIRD = 2

  attr_accessor :type

  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
  end
  
  def speak(words)
    puts words
  end
end

animals = [Animal.new(Animal.DOG), Animal.new(Animal.CAT), Animal.new(Animal.BIRD)]

animals.each |animal| do
  case animal.type
  when Animal.DOG
    animal.speak('bark')
  when Animal.CAT
    animal.speak('meow')
  when Animal.BIRD
    animal.speak('tweet')
  end
end
```

### polymorphism vs inheritance

It depends on the business logic to determine which one to be used. Think about your database. If we use inheritance, then there will be a new model produced which you can create a table associate with it and you will not need runtime to calculate the logics, of which you cost more space but save more time and vice versa.

For example, the same `Dog` class. If you are running a zoo, you will not need a table for `Dog` and you just need a polymorphism table, `Animal`, to list all the animals with type in that table. But if you are running, a store professionally takes good care about dogs, then you need a `Dog` model inherited from `Animal`.

### Unified Model Language

It is a language to describe the relationship between models. The relationships: inheritance, composition, aggregation, association, link (solid), dependency, realization, link (dashed)

<div class="mermaid">
classDiagram
  classA --|> classB : Inheritance
  classC --* classD : Composition
  classE --o classF : Aggregation
  classG --> classH : Association
</div>

<div class="mermaid">
classDiagram
  classI -- classJ : Link(Solid)
  classK ..> classL : Dependency
  classM ..|> classN : Realization
  classO .. classP : Link(Dashed)
</div>

#### inheritance

A inherited from B -> A has all attributes and methods from B; for example, student is inherited from person.

#### composition

C composed of D -> D is a part of C; for example, car is composed of wheels.

#### aggregation
