## Introduction

### easy explanation

Lemon juice tastes sour and soap water tastes bitter because lemon is acid and soap is base.

* Acid has burning effect
* acid + base = salt + water
* indicators help us to know whether the solution is acid or base

### theory

This article describes the concept of acid and base with theories:

* Arrhenius
* Brønsted–Lowry
* Lewis

(The domain of theories: Arrhenius ⊆ Brønsted–Lowry ⊆ Lewis)

The factors affect the strength of acid:

* bond polarity (electronegativity): the higher electronegativity -> the higher power to attract electron -> the higher chance to release proton (such as $$H^+$$) -> the higher acidity
* bond strength:
* conjugate base stability:

## Why?



## How?

### Arrhenius

Given our knowledge of chemistry, (TBC)

### Brønsted–Lowry

Brønsted–Lowry acid is a substance donating $$H^+$$ and Brønsted–Lowry base is a substance accepting $$H^+$$

$$HA + B ⇌ A^- + HB^+$$

(acid + base ⇌ conjugate base + conjugate acid)

* example: $$CH_3COOH + H_2O ⇌ CH_3COO^- + H_3O^+$$

### Lewis

defines on electronic level
