## Introduction

This article

## Why?

focus on why we need it

## How?

### Boyle’s law

Given constant external environment, pressure is inversely proportional to the volume

$$PV = k$$, $$k$$ is constant

### Charles’s law

Given constant external environment, volumn is proportional to temperature

$$V = kT$$, $$k$$ is constant

### Avogadro’s law

Given constant external environment, volumn is proportional to mole

$$V = nk$$, $$k$$ is constant

### Ideal gas law

Given the laws above,

$$pV = nRT$$

* p is pressure
* V is volumn
* T is temperature
* n is amount of substance
* R is ideal gas constant

### Dalton’s law of partial pressures

For example, given mixture gas: 2 moles of $$Ar$$ + 3 moles of $$O_2$$ + 5 moles of $$N_2$$ in total pressure of 1000 torr.

* the pressure of $$Ar$$ = 1000 * 2 / (2+3+5)
* the pressure of $$O_2$$ = 1000 * 3 / (2+3+5)
* the pressure of $$N_2$$ = 1000 * 5 / (2+3+5)

## What?

give an example

## Note

* SI unit: pascal; $$1 atm = 101,325 Pa$$
* ,$$1 torr = 1 mm Hg$$
* ,$$1 atm = 760 torr$$
