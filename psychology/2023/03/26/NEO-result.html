  <li>My result
    <ul>

Stressful and frustrating situations are somewhat upsetting to you, but you are generally able to get over these feelings and cope with these situations.</li>
      <li>Your score on Anxiety is <strong>high</strong> (15 of 20). The “fight-or-flight” system of the brain of anxious individuals is too easily and too often engaged. Therefore, people who are high in anxiety often feel like something dangerous is about to happen. They may be afraid of specific situations or be just generally fearful. They feel tense, jittery, and nervous. Persons low in Anxiety are generally calm and fearless.</li>
      <li>Your score on Anger is <strong>average</strong> (14 of 20). Persons who score high in Anger feel enraged when things do not go their way.

Their concern about rejection and ridicule cause them to feel shy and uncomfortable abound others. They are easily embarrassed and often feel ashamed.

      <li>Your score on Immoderation is <strong>average</strong> (8 of 20). Immoderate individuals feel strong cravings and urges that they have have difficulty resisting.

They generally find it more difficult to relate to the unstraightforward low-scorers on this scale.
