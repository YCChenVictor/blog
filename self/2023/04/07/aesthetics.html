<h3 id="philosophy-approach">Philosophy Approach</h3>

<p>Aesthetic experiences encompass various aspects, such as listening to music in different settings, adorning personal items with stickers, appreciating the beauty of a sunset, savoring the first bite of a meal, and emotionally investing in characters portrayed in movies or novels, all of which aim to capture the essence of beauty and convey personal perspectives.</p>

<p>Originating from Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten, aesthetics emerged as a field that defines the qualities of good art by exploring notions of taste and its connection to beauty.</p>

<p>According to Plato, art serves as an imitation of ordinary life, portraying objects and events from our everyday existence.</p>

<p>In contrast to merely depicting external appearances, Aristotle believed that the purpose of art lies in conveying the profound significance and intrinsic essence of things, underscoring the importance of engaging deeply with the universe to truly appreciate and connect with its gifts, urging us to move beyond superficial understanding and explore the depths of our inner world and the vastness of the universe through meaningful experiences.</p>

<p>To truly experience the gifts bestowed by the universe, one must engage with them firsthand through activities such as travel, immersion in nature, reading to gain different perspectives, and delving into spiritual or introspective practices to explore the depths of one’s inner world.</p>

<p>Authenticity and genuine emotions are crucial in expressing one’s feelings towards the world and nature, tapping into the true desires and passions that lie within. It involves discovering one’s <a href="/blog/aesthetics/2023/04/29/central-ideas.html">central ideas</a> and contemplating how to blend them with the gifts received from the universe.</p>

<p>The process of mingling these experiences and emotions can be documented and expressed through various <a href="/blog/aesthetics/2023/04/29/creative-outlets.html">creative outlets</a>, such as writing, drawing, music, cooking, and more, allowing for a deeper exploration and expression of one’s unique aesthetic journey.</p>

<h2 id="what">What?</h2>
